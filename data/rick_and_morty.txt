robot voice: arming neutrino bomb. 
morty: (unbuckles his seatbelt) that's it... that's it, rick. i'm taking the wheel. (jumps up on rick and starts fighting with him over control of the wheel)

morty: oh, thank god. 
rick: you know what? that was all a test, morty. just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.

summer: oh my god, his head is in his food. i'm going to puke. 
beth: morty, are you getting sick? (morty lifts his head, clearly exhausted, and wipes food from his face) i told you not to practice-kiss the living room pillow. the dog sleeps on it. 
morty: i wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. i just i didn't get a lot of sleep last night. maybe my dreams were just too loud or something. 
summer: or maybe you were out all night again with grandpa rick. 
jerry: what? 
beth: dad? 
rick: what, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? you realize that nighttime makes up half of all time? 
jerry: damn it! 
beth: jerry! 
jerry: beth! 
summer: oh my god, my parents are so loud, i want to die. 
rick: mm, there is no god, summer. you gotta rip that band-aid off now. you'll thank me later. 
jerry: (glaring at rick) okay, with all due respect, rick what am i talking about? what respect is due? how is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept sci-fi rigamarole? 
rick: listen, jerry. i-i-i don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. it's your house. it's your world. you're a real julius caesar but i'll tell you something tell you how i feel about school, jerry. it's a waste of time. (jerry stares incredulously at him) buncha people running around, bumping into each other. g-guy up front says,"two plus two."the people in the back say,"four."then the then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. i mean, it's not a place for smart people, jerry. and i know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue. (wipes his mouth and gets up, stopping behind beth and putting a hand on her shoulder) this was a good breakfast, beth. you really made the crap out of those eggs. i wish your mother was here to eat them. (rick gives beth a kiss and walks away) 
beth: (tears up in happiness) oh, dad

morty: jessica. 
mr goldenfold: five plus five. 
all classmates except morty: ten. 
morty: jessica. (jessica hears morty and looks back, confused, not sure who s saying her name) 
mr goldenfold: okay, good. it's time for the quiz. 
class: awwwwww. 
mr goldenfold: yeah, you know what?! aw, too bad! tough! first row, take one. pass it back for me. the stakes are high in this room. (morty stares at the quiz; the numbers on the quiz jumble together as morty falls asleep) there's crucial things happening here every day. people getting smarter. some of y'all getting dumber. some of y'all ain't gonna see 3 00. (morty falls into a dream world filled with large number-shaped blocks; jessica steps out from behind some of the numbers) 
jessica: hi, morty. 
morty: whoa! hi, jessica. 
jessica: can i show these to you? (jessica opens her shirt, showing morty her breasts) 
morty: wow. th-they're both great. thank you! 
jessica: you know what i named these? my little morties. 
morty: (rubs the back of his neck) uh, that's flattering... and a little weird. 
jessica: do you know what i want you to do with them? 
morty: rename them? 
jessica: squeeze them. manhandle them. give them the business. see if you can shuffle them. i mean, really get in there and knock them around. no wrong answers. 
morty: wow. well, okay, jessica. l-let's give this a shot. (morty grabs her breasts and starts fondling her) 
jessica: mm. oh, morty. what are you doing to me? 
morty: uh, i-i'm just doing my best. (in real life, class has ended and morty is fondling mr. goldenfold)

morty: uh, morning, frank. 
frank: (pins morty to his locker)"morning"? what was what is that supposed to mean? you making fun of me? are you trying to say my family's poor? (takes out a pocket knife and points it at morty's neck) 
morty: oh, geez, frank. i don't know if a knife is necessary. i mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it. 
frank: you telling me how to bully now? big mistake, morty and now i'm gonna cut you,'cause my family's rich. (frank suddenly freezes and rick steps out from behind him) 
rick: there you are, morty. listen to me. i got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. i need an extra pair of hands. 
morty: oh, geez, rick. w-w-what'd you do to frank? 
rick: it's pretty obvious, morty. i froze him. now listen i need your help, morty. i mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business. (burps) it's important. come on, morty. 
morty: i don't know, rick. i can't leave school again. 
rick: do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, morty? what do you think i can just do it all by myself? come on! 
morty: aw, geez. okay. i guess i can skip history. what about frank? i mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him? 
rick: i'll do it later, morty. he'll be fine. let's go. (takes off with morty and then summer comes by, seeing frank's frozen body) 
summer in her head: oh, my god. i'm about to walk past frank palicky. this is the story we'll be telling our children. (walks up to frank and talks to him, oblivious to the fact that he's frozen) 
summer: hi, frank. (frank's frozen foot breaks and he drops to the ground and shatters into a million pieces, dying)

tom: (offscreen) losing him. (beth adjusts the organs again) 
tom: (offscreen) stabilized. 
beth: okay, i only ask, jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery. 
jerry: well, yeah, on horses. 
beth: excuse me? 
jerry: okay, let's not rehash that fight. i sense that you're busy and will now be on my way. (drops a pamphlet on the ground)

[cut to alleyway] 
rick: there she is. all right. come on, morty. let's go. 
morty: oh, geez, okay. (rick and morty go through the portal and end up in a crazy alternate dimension) 
morty: oh, man, rick. what is this place? 
rick: it's dimension 35-c, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, morty, called a mega tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. i'm talking about mega seeds. they're they're incredibly powerful, and i need them to help me with my research, morty. 
morty: oh, man, rick. i'm looking around this place, and i'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing. 
rick: all right, all right, calm down. listen to me, morty. i know that new situations can be intimidating. you're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. i'm no stranger to scary situations. i deal with them all the time. now, if you just stick with me, morty, we're gonna be (a gigantic alien monster suddenly appears behind them) 
rick: holy crap, morty run!!! (they take off, running in complete and total fear as the monster chases them)

[cut to black] 
rick: (having apparently escaped, they are walking through dimension 35-c, continuing their adventure) oh, morty, take a deep breath. breathe that breathe that fresh air in, morty. y-you smell that? that's the smell of adventure, morty. that's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline. 
morty: all right, rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? shouldn't i be back at school by now? 
rick: are you joking me? i mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. look at that thing right there. (a weird looking monster is seen cooing and rolling around on the ground) what the hell is that thing? you think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school? (offscreen) look at it just lumbering around. (onscreen) it defies all logic, that thing. 
morty: yeah, rick, i get it. we're surrounded by monsters. that's kind of the reason why i want to leave. (they come up to a cliff and rick stops him there) 
rick: ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. morty, you see this? (he and morty are looking down upon a vast forest of interdimensional trees) 
rick: you see what we just stumbled upon, morty? any idea what that is down there? 
morty: the mega trees? 
rick: that's right, morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that's what i'm talking about, morty. that's where my seeds are. if we would have done what you wanted, i would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school. 
morty: all right, all right. so, what's so special about these seeds, anyways? 
rick: you ask a lot of questions, morty. not very charismatic. it makes you kind of an (burps) under- (burps) underfoot figure. (rick gives morty a pair of shoes and morty proceeds to put them on) 
rick: just take these shoes, morty. they're (burps) special grappling shoes. when you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. these things really bring it all together.

beth: i am not putting my father in a home! he just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's victoria's secret? 
jerry: i told you i was ordering you something for valentine's day. more importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son. 
davin: everything cool in here, beth? 
beth: it's fine, davin. 
davin: okay, cool. you know, we did something great today. there's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse. (jerry closes the door on davin) 
jerry: since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, i will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies. 
beth: look, i appreciate the stress you're under, but morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence i can see rick having is that, for the first time in his life, morty has a friend. (the phone starts ringing) 
jerry: (sighs) well, maybe you're right. 
beth: uh, yeah, maybe i am. i'm my father's daughter. i'm smart. why do you think i'm a heart surgeon? 
jerry: (coughs) ahem, horse heart surgeon. (beth answers the phone and gets a call from morty's principal, gene vagina) 
principal vagina: hello? mrs. smith? this is principal vagina, no relation. i wonder if you and morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon?

rick: (standing by morty, who is lying on the ground with his legs broken) morty, oh, you really d-did a number on (offscreen) your legs right now. you know, you got to turn (onscreen) the shoes on, morty, for them to work. yeah, look i turned mine on. i had no problem getting down here. it was a leisurely breeze. 
morty: i'm in a lot of pain, rick! 
rick: yeah, i can see that. but do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, morty? 
morty: are you kidding me?! that's it, rick! that's the last straw! i can't believe this! i'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! ooh! ow! oh! y-y-you're a monster. y-you're like hitler, but-but even hitler cared about germany or something. 
rick: okay, hold on just a second, morty. (opens another portal and leaves morty behind, lying on the ground to suffer for a few seconds) 
morty: ooh! ohh! ooh! hnngh! hoo! ooh! ohh! aaaaagh! oooooh! (rick finally returns and injects morty's legs with medicine, healing them to perfection) 
morty: ooh, ohh, ooh. wow, rick. that stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. i mean, i've never felt so good in my life. thank you. 
rick: don't worry about it, morty. just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy? 
morty: sure thing, rick. (goes up the tree and gets the mega fruit while rick talks to him) 
rick: not that you asked, morty, but what just happened there is i went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore. (offscreen) the stuff was all over the place, morty. 
morty: wow, that's pretty crazy, rick. 
rick: there's just one problem, morty one little hang-up. the dimension i visited was so advanced, that (burps) they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, morty, and they had been forever. i was the only old person there, morty. (burps) it was like i was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. i-i was fascinating to them. there were a lot of attractive women there, morty, and they-they-they they all wanted time with me. i had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but i spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, morty. it's got no charge left. 
morty: what?! 
rick: it's as good as garbage, morty. it's not gonna work anymore, morty. 
morty: oh, geez, rick, that's not good. w-what are we gonna do? i-i have to be back at school right now. how are we gonna get back home? 
rick: there's ways to get back home, morty. it's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. we're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid. 
morty: uh-oh. 
rick: when we get to customs, i'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and i'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, morty. 
morty: in my butt? 
rick: put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit. 
morty: oh, geez, rick. i really don't want to have to do that. 
rick: well, somebody's got to do it, morty. th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, morty 
morty: uuuh. 
rick: and they'll fall right out of mine. i've done this too many times, morty. i mean, you're young. y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. you got to do it for grandpa, morty. y- (burps) you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.

morty: oh, man.

jerry: boom! told you! in your face! he is ruining our child! wait, what am i celebrating? 
principal vagina: yeah, see, i thought something was fishy there, because it's usually morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school. (they stop to see summer and some other students, crying at an obituary for frank) 
beth: summer? 
summer: (sobs) what kind of god lets this happen? 
principal vagina: we had a little incident. a student was frozen to death. (chuckles) and there's no evidence that a latino student did it! everyone wants to take this to a racial place. i won't let them.

rick: (morty comes up to him, who is waiting in line to get through security) i don't like it here, morty. i can't abide bureaucracy. i don't like being told where to go and what to do. i consider it a violation. did you get those seeds all the way up your butt? 
morty: yeah, rick. let's just get this over with, okay? i mean, these things are pointy. they hurt. 
rick: that means they're good ones. you're a good kid, morty. those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. you've been a huge help to me. i'm gonna be able to do a- 
(burps) all kind of things with them. it's gonna be great, morty. a- (burps) all kinds of science. (aliens are going through security with a gromflomite, letting them through) 
gromflomite: okay, next through. (stops morty) except you. you go over there. 
rick: why does he have to go over there? 
gromflomite: random check. he's got to go through the new machine. 
rick: what new- (burps) what new machine? 
gromflomite: it's a new machine. it detects stuff all the way up your butt. 
rick: run, morty! run! (grabs morty and they run through security and dart for the exit) 
morty: aaaaaah! 
gromfomite: red alert! (team of gromflomites starts chasing after rick and morty) 
morty: ohhhhh! (rick pushes over a giant capsule, with an alien fetus over, smashing some gromflomites, to slow them down) 
morty: ohhhhhh! (an alien is seen smoking a hookah and morty runs past him and accidentally inhales the smoke from the hookah while rick comes from behind and slaps the alien in the face, causing the alien to cry; he then coughs up a life form from the smoke and the lifeform starts running through the glarp zone and goes through the entire aging process from developing fetus to decomposing corpse, over the course of three seconds) 
morty: aaaaah! 
rick: don't think about it! (he and morty are cornered but morty activates the grappling shoes and runs up the wall with rick) 
rick: ooh! oh, nice, morty! the student becomes the teacher. (the gromflomites reveal that they can fly and then rick and morty start running away)

alien: aah! aw, hell, no, dawg. you know me i'm just trying to (rick and morty crash to the ground and he dies; they then run to the portal computer) 
rick: i need to type in the coordinates to our home world, morty. cover me. (he tosses morty a gun) 
morty: oh, man. i mean, you know, i-i don't want to shoot nobody. 
rick: they're just robots, morty! it's okay to shoot them! they're robots! (morty shoots a glenn, blowing his leg off, and making blood gush out as he drops down in pain) 
glenn: aaaaah! my leg is shot off! 
other gromflomite: glenn's bleeding to death! someone call his wife and children! 
morty: they're not robots, rick! 
rick: it's a figure of speech, morty. they're bureaucrats. i don't respect them. just keep shooting, morty. you have no idea what prison is like here! (morty continues shooting the gromflomites and even kills some innocent bystanders while rick hacks into the portal to take them back home) 
morty: holy crap! this is insane! (rick opens the portal and takes morty in with him) 
rick: come on, morty! we got to get the hell out of here! (the portal opens up in the lunchroom at school and rick and morty land on the table where jessica and her friends are eating) 
jessica: wow. did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal? 
morty: uh, yeah. well, you know, my-my ferrari's in the shop. (nervously laughs) just kidding. 
jessica: you're morty, right? 
morty: yeah. (rick grabs morty and takes him way) 
rick: you can get his number later. come on, morty. we got to get out of here. you got to get those seeds out of your ass. (rick and morty are stopped by jerry, beth, and principal vagina) 
jerry: oh, look, honey. it's our son with albert ein-douche. 
beth: what? 
jerry: i'm an angry father, not an improviser. 
rick: oh, hi, jerry. oh, my goodness, morty! what are you doing out of class? we talked about this. your-your parents and i are very disappointed in-in this behavior... no? no takers? (rick and morty are back at home in the garage while jerry and beth start taking all his things and packing them up so he can move to the nursing home) 
rick: you guys should really not be touching that stuff. it's beyond your reasoning. 
jerry: you're beyond our reasoning! 
rick: takes one to know one. 
beth: dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? i mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. he can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's. 
rick: what what are you guys doing with my stuff? 
beth: we're moving you to a nursing home. 
rick: a nursing home? what are what are you, nuts? i'm a genius. i build robots for fun. 
jerry: well, now you can build baskets and watch paul newman movies on vhs and mentally scar the boy scouts every christmas. 
beth: what does that mean? 
jerry: it's personal. 
morty: dad, mom, come on. rick just needed my help is all. 
jerry: morty, stay out of this. you are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own. 
rick: what are you trying to say about morty? that he's stupid or something? 
beth: oh, don't high-road us, dad. you know fully well that morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes. 
rick: i-i-i don't know what you mean by that. can can can you be a little bit more specific? 
jerry: oh, for crying out he's got some kind of disability or something. is that what you want us to say? 
morty: i do? 
jerry: well, duh doy, son. look, i love you, morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard. 
morty: aw, geez, dad. y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once. 
rick: morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi. 
morty: oh, come on, rick. you know i can't. 
rick: the square root of pi, morty. go! 
morty: 1.77245385... whoa! 
beth: what the hell? 
jerry: (checks morty's answer with calculator) holy crap. he's right. 
rick: morty, tell your parents the first law of thermodynamics. 
morty:"the increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."wow! i'm so smart! 
jerry: but 
rick: i told the both of you school is stupid. it's not how you learn things. morty's a gifted child. he has a special mind. that's why he's my little helper. he's like me. he's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. he's too smart for school. he needs to keep hanging out and helping me. 
beth: jerry, i don't want whatever's happening here to stop. 
jerry: no, i-i understand. uh, maybe we overreacted. but he has to keep going to school. 
rick: okay, jerry. you drive a hard bargain, but what am i supposed to do? say no? you-you really wear the pants around here. i just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication. (summer butts in, crying over the death of frank) 
summer: (crying) frank palicky was frozen to death today! 
rick: no idea what you're talking about. (summer leaves, crying) 
jerry: okay. well, uh, morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. don't stay up all night again. this is good, though. this can work. i think we can be a family and now, beth, if you'll have me, i would love to have you. 
beth: you know what? okay. (she and jerry leave) 
morty: holy cow, rick. i didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter. 
rick: full disclosure, morty it's not. temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity. 
morty: aw, man. 
rick: yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, morty. 
starting right about now.  morty: ohh, man. (losing consciousness) oh, geez! ohh. (drops to the ground and starts moaning as he has a seizure) 
rick: i'm sorry, morty. it's a bummer. in reality, you're as dumb as they come and i needed those seeds real bad, and i had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures. (excitedly looks down upon him, telling him about their future adventures) and then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, morty but if you stick with me, i'm gonna accomplish great things, morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, morty. we're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, morty. just you and me, morty. the outside world is our enemy, morty. we're the only friends we've got, morty. it's just rick and morty. rick and morty and their adventures, morty. rick and morty forever and forever. morty's things. me and rick and morty running around, and rick and morty time. all day long, forever. all a hundred days. rick and morty forever 100 times. over and over, rickandmortyadventures. com. all 100 years. every minute, rickandmorty. com.

[the smith family is seen sitting around the table eating breakfast. the viewer at this point doesn't know that this scene is set in a dimension that is not dimension c-137 with a different smith family, but this will be apparent at the end of the scene.] 
beth: so dad, guess what tomorrow is... 
rick: martin luther king jr.'s birthday. 
beth: no... well, it might be... 
rick: it is. 
beth: fine, but also, tomorrow is your one year anniversary back in our lives. i'm gonna make you flying saucer-shaped pancakes. 
rick: oh, there's no need to do that, beth. regular pancakes are fine. 
(a portal appears on their wall and evil rick and evil morty emerge from it carrying a gun and a tranquilizer respectively. evil rick shoots rick in the head and kills him. evil morty shoots morty in the shoulder with his tranquilizer and he passes out. evil morty then drags morty across the breakfast table and he and evil rick drag morty through the portal, and the portal disappears. the family screams in horror the entire time.) 
[opening sequence plays] 
(the smith family is seen sitting around the table eating breakfast. this scene takes place in dimension c-137) 
beth: happy anniversary, dad! 
rick: oh, i get it. regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers.[takes bite] mmm, i should be making you breakfast for putting up with me. 
jerry: should be making us a whole restaurant. 
beth: nonsense, we couldn t be happier to have you around. i just wish i got to see more of you. 
(three armed ricks come into the room through a portal) 
rick 1: rick sanchez of earth dimension c-137. you are under arrest for crimes against alternate ricks by the authority of the transdimensional council of ricks. 
jerry: hey! what the heck? 
rick 1: neutralise the jerry. 
jerry: wait, no! 
(rick 2 shoots at jerry, freezing him) 
summer: dad! 
beth: dad! 
morty: rick! 
rick c-137: everybody relax. if i know these a-holes, and i am these a-holes, they just wanna haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions. let s get it over with. 
rick 1: bring his mo-[belches]-orty. 
morty: oh, man. 
rick c-137: leave my[belches] morty out of this! 
rick 1: you lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to join[belches] the council. 
beth: wait, wh-wh-wh-what about jerry? 
rick c-137: will you at least unfreeze my daughter s idiot? 
(rick 1 unfreezes jerry. rick 2 and rick 3 take rick through the portal and all exit) 
jerry:-give you anything! i have a rare antique coin collection, just don t hurt me![pauses] okay, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting. they have little r2d2s instead of george washingtons. 
beth: our son s been abducted! 
jerry: you hate me for buying those coins! 
[transition to ext citadel of ricks] 
[transition to int citadel of ricks. the three armed ricks and c-137 rick and morty enter through a portal] 
morty c-137: geez, rick! wh-what is this place? 
rick c-137: the citadel of ricks. it s the secret headquarters for the council of ricks. 
morty c-137: council of ricks? 
rick c-137: as you know, morty, i ve got a lotta enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat. galactic terrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government wh-wherever you find people with heads up their asses someone wants a piece of your grandpa. and a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem. so a few thousand versions of me had the ingenious idea of banding together like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on yahoo answers. 
morty c-137: hey, what do you know? it s a cowboy version of me! 
rick c-137: geez, you re easy to impress. yeah, most timelines have a rick and most ricks have a morty. this place is a real who s-who of who s you and me. 
rick salesman 1: turn your boring old morty into a hot fashion statement, with some morty dazzlers! 
rick salesman 2: hey, check this out! 
(rick salesman 2 holds up a morty doll and presses a button in the middle) 
morty doll: show me the morty! 
rick c-137: dumb. 
rick salseman 3: scuse me, sir, is your morty insured? you know, every year hundreds of mortys are injured in- 
rick c-137: back off! not my cup of tea, this place. 
[transition to hallway leading to the council] 
rick c-137: i say the point of being a rick is being a rick. 
rick 1: save your anti-rick speech for the council of ricks, terror-rick! 
rick c-137: hey, save your rick rules for the[belches] sheep-ricks, rick-pig! 
rick 1: fuck me, pal. 
rick c-137: fuck you? no no no no no, fuck me! 
(they reach the end of the hallway and the door opens automatically, revealing the council of ricks) 
rick council 1: bring up the holograms! 
(a screen depicting several dead ricks appears) 
rick council 1: twenty-seven ricks brutally murdered in their own timelines. an unprecedented rick-icidal epidemic. what say you, earth rick c-137? 
rick c-137: you think i did this? why am i the first rick you pull in every time a rick stubs his toe? 
rick council 1: you[belches] have a history of non-cooperation with the council. 
rick c-137: yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as rick! wh-wh-wh-why isn t he here in handcuffs? 
rick council 1: because he s dead too! 
rick crowd: no! 
rick council 1: who else would you have us question? you fit the profile. of all the ricks in the central finite curve, you re the malcontent. the rogue. 
rick c-137: i m the rick. and so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance. you wanted to be safe from the government so you became a stupid government. that makes every rick here less rick than me. 
rick crowd: (can you believe this guy? this guy needs to get out of here, etc. ad lib) 
rick c-137: yeah, murmur it up, d-bags. now if you ll excuse me, i ve got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them. they re about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste. and i hate to get all andy rooney about it, but i think we all like fluffy discs of cake with syrup on top! and i think we also like to be accused of crimes when there s evidence! so as they say in canada, peace oot! 
rick council 1: evidence? good idea. scan his portal gun! 
(rick 1 reaches into c-137’s lab coat and retrieves his portal gun) 
rick c-137: oh, come on. don t look at another man s portal gun history. we-we all go to weird places. 
rick council 1: yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occured! 
(a diagram appears on the screen, displaying c-137’s portal gun history. entries for certain dimensions flash green before it finally settles on a select few which flash red) 
rick c-137: what? that s rick-diculous. i m obviously being set up! 
rick council 1: earth rick c-137! the council of ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you know becomes impossible to grasp. also every ten seconds it stabs your balls. 
rick c-137: i ve heard enough. 
(c-137 elbows rick 1 and tackles him into rick 2, taking his gun and shooting through his own and then morty’s handcuffs. the two run away) 
rick c-137: run, morty! 
(a morty from the crowd starts to run too) 
crowd rick: uh uh, not you! 
[transition to back to corridor. rick and morty (c-137) are running, and are being chased by ricks] 
morty c-137: aaaaah! 
(rick shoots into the side walls with his portal gun. as the chasing ricks pass, several of them get set on fire, attacked by insects, dragged into the portals by tentacles or hit by falling pumpkins) 
armed rick 1: nooo! 
armed rick 2: arrrrgh! ahhhh! 
armed rick 3: aaaah! 
armed ricks 4 and 5: oof! 
(the two reach the end of the corridor, which cuts off to a moveable ramp which is currently down and is blocked by a railing. they leap over. as they fall, rick c-137 shoots a portal beneath them which they then fall through) 
[transition to buttworld. rick and morty c-137 fall through a portal onto a large butt mountain. they bounce off and continue running] 
morty c-137: oh! oooh! 
(rick c-137 shoots a portal in between two buttcheeks, which they run through, with the other ricks in hot pursuit) 
[transition to pizza dimension. a pizza sits on a couch dialing on a phone, while another is lying down on another couch) 
pizza 1: yeah, i d like to order one large person with extra people please. 
pizza 2: white people. no no no no no, black people. and hispanic on half. 
(c-137 rick and morty run out of a portal and shoot another portal onto the opposite wall, then run through. the ricks and mortys chasing them follow) 
[trans greasy grandma world]
(the dimension is full of greasy grandmas a banner says welcome to greasy grandma world population) 
(c-137 rick and morty run through, avoiding the grandmas as much as possible. they shoot another portal in the wall and run through. the ricks and mortys chasing them follow) 
[transition to phone dimension. a phone sits on a pizza dialing on a person, while another is lying down on another pizza] 
phone 1: yes, i d like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair please. 
phone 2: high chair. no no no no no, recliner! and wheelchair on half. 
(c-137 rick and morty run out of a portal and shoot another portal onto the opposite wall, then run through. the ricks and mortys chasing them follow) 
[transition to doopidoo dimension. several doopidoo creatures stand around repeating the phrase “doopidoo” over and over] 
(rick c-137 shoots several portals into the wall, and enters the last one. the ricks and mortys chasing them enter the dimension but don’t know which portal to go into) 
armed rick 6: they could have gone into any one of these. 
armed ricks: (ugh, son of a-, aw geez, aw man, we lost him, etc. ad lib) 
[transition to chair dimension. a sofa sits on a person dialing on a pizza, while another is lying down on another person) 
sofa 1: yeah, i d like to order one large phone with extra phones please. 
sofa 2: cellphone. no no no no no, rotary! and payphone on half. 
(c-137 rick and morty run out of a portal) 
rick: that ll keep em[belches] busy for a while. 
morty: those guys were wrong, right? you don t-you wouldn t kill yourself y-yourselves? 
rick: course not, morty! how could that profit me? someone out there is killing ricks, and the council ain t gonna stop thinking it s me until we clear our names. 
(the two pass a homeless sofa, who’s initially drinking but stares at them as they pass and dumps out his bottle) 
rick: by finding the real rick killer. 
morty: i m scared, rick! maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons like that show doomsday preppers. 
rick: not really my style, morty. besides, your home is most likely swarming with ricks right now. 
[transition to smith living room. jerry’s reading a newspaper, summer’s on her phone, and a bunch of ricks and mortys are searching the place] 
rick 1: alright, listen, jerry. if rick calls, this device is going to trace his location. you just gotta keep em on the phone for thirty seconds or longer. 
beth: who wants lemonade? 
rick 1: oh yeah! mmm! oh, delicious! 
rick 2: beth,[belches] you re a treasure. 
rick 3: i have a beth just like you in my[belches] reality, except you know what? she s not as brilliant or[belches] attractive! 
beth: aww, thank[belches] you! 
all ricks: ohohoho! she did it! she did it! 
(phone rings. rick 4 makes a signal to say they’re tracing the signal. jerry picks it up) 
jerry: uh, hello? 
rick phone: hey jerry, it s rick. 
jerry: rick! heyy. haha, what s-what s up? 
rick phone: so listen, the heat s on and[belches] there s nowhere left to turn so morty and i are just going to fly my spaceship into a black hole. 
jerry: what? 
rick phone: is that cool with you, dog? 
jerry: rick, no! mortyyyy! 
rick 4: i got it! the call s coming from inside the house! 
all ricks: [laughing] (look at his face! i can t believe our daughter married you, too easy, etc. ad lib) 
[transition to chair dimension. rick and morty are in a restaurant run by chairs] 
rick: the ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with jerry. they won t be able to help themselves. but as soon as they get bored they ll be on to us. 
chair waiter: phones á la clams, and phonesgetti with phoneballs. anything else? 
rick: yeah, more phonesticks please. 
phone waiter: right away, sir. 
morty: you know rick, when i first saw all those ricks and mortys, i thought gee, that kinda devalues our bond. but then i realised that just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines. 
rick: yeah, it s gotta be that way. you re a camouflage. 
morty: camouflage? wh-wh-what are you talking about, rick? 
rick: ricks have a very distinct and traceable brainwave due to our genius. the best way to hide from an enemy s radar is to stand near someone with complementary brainwaves that make ours invisible. see, wh-wh-when a rick is with a morty, the genius waves get cancelled out by the uh,[clears throat] morty waves. 
morty: um because our personalities are so different? 
rick: oh, shit dog! my portal gun was hacked remotely morty, obviously by the real killer to frame me. but i was able to trace the signal. come on, let s go! 
(the two stand up. as they’re about to leave, two ricks and a morty enter the restaurant and address the waiter) 
rick c-137: uh-oh! 
rick 1: scuse me, we ve tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location. they look exactly like us, so in order to avoid confusion i m going to mark us each with a red x right now. that way if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot the other one because they re the evil one, you ll know who s lying. 
rick 2: hey, check it out! 
(two person-chairs that look like rick and morty from behind are beside a table. when the two ricks rush over to turn them around, it’s revealed that they’re not) 
rick 1: dammit! 
(they look out the window, to see c-137 flipping them off from in a police hovercraft. they rush outside, and the waiter follows) 
chair waiter: hey, you didn t pay your bill! 
rick 1: the red x! red x! 
[transition to green planet. rick and morty are flying in the police hovercraft, searching] 
rick: hey, it s a good thing that space outlet had labcoats and your favourite kind of shirt in stock, huh morty? 
morty: yeah, rick. i-i heard you the first time. you don t have to keep saying it over and over and over. 
rick: man, this place is wayyy off the grid. this guy does not wanna be found. 
morty: well, if he s a rick, doesn t he just have to stand by a morty to hide? i mean, isn t that what mortys are? human cloaking devices? 
rick: morty, you re making a bigger deal out of this than it is. 
(in the distance a dome comes into view. faint yelling can be heard) 
morty: oh my god, rick, look! there s a bunch of people strapped all over that building! 
rick: not people, morty. mortys. 
(as they get closer, it’s revealed that the dome is covered top to bottom in naked mortys, who are strapped to the surface and are being tortured with contraptions that stab their sides constantly. constant morty yelling can be heard) 
morty c-137: oh my god wh-why would somebody do this? it s horrible! 
rick: well, one morty s enough to hide from the bureaucrats. but you g-you get a whole matrix of mortys and put em in agonising pain. that creates a pattern that can hide even from other ricks, motherfucker. i fiddled with a[belches] concept like this once. 
(they land. morty stares at rick) 
rick: on paper, morty, on paper! i wouldn t do this, it s barbaric overkill. i mean, you could accomplish the same result with like five mortys and a jumper cable.[pauses as morty glares at him] which i also wouldn t do! i m just saying, it s bad craftsmanship. 
[transition to smith living room. ricks are playing cards while mortys watch. jerry’s on his laptop] 
beth: coffee time! 
all ricks: (yeah! that s what i like to hear! etc. ad lib) 
(the ricks run into the kitchen, and the mortys take the place of the ricks on the cards table. doofus rick enters the house) 
jerry: ugh. 
doofus rick: hi jerry! 
jerry: leave me alone, i m working! 
doofus rick: oh, you are? wh-wh-what do you do? 
jerry: ugh. i m-i m in between advertising jobs. 
doofus rick: advertising? wow! so, people need help figuring out what to buy and then y-you help them? 
jerry: w-well, it s a little more complicated than that 
doofus rick: well, i mean, you do it, and you seem like a guy that really has it all together! 
jerry:[looks around for hiding ricks] dude, are you wh-you re being a dick, right? 
doofus rick: oh gosh, wh-i hope not! i-i-i-i wouldn t want to offend you in any way! 
jerry: you re really a rick? 
doofus rick: ohoho! y-of course i am! just as much as my morty s a morty! 
(doofus rick’s morty waves to doofus rick from the poker table) 
jerry: hey, he looks a lot like eric stoltz from the movie mask. you know, the one with cher in it? 
doofus rick: that s right, jerry! he-he s from a reality where everyone is eric stoltz mask people! he s eric stoltz mask morty! they assigned him to me because i never had any kids of my own. but if i did, boy, i d love em if they were as smart and as successful as you are, jerry. 
(ricks return with coffee) 
rick 1: hey, get a load of this! jerry s hanging out with doofus rick. 
rick 2: haha, this is perfect. 
doofus rick: i m not doofus rick! i m rick j-19-zeta-7! 
rick 1: oh, is that the timeline where everybody eats poop? jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right? 
doofus rick: hey! i don t eat poop! y-you guys are always so mean to me! 
rick 1 and 2:[laughing] 
doofus rick: i guess it s only fair to tell you now, jerry i m the worst rick of them all. 
jerry: according to who? other versions of you? if i ve learned one thing, it s that before you get anywhere in life, you gotta stop listening to yourself. 
doofus rick: wow, you really are wise, jerry. i-i guess that s why you work in advertising! 
jerry: the fact that you feel that way makes you the best rick of them all. 
[transition to int dome. rick and morty are exploring corridors] 
morty: you don t care about me at all! i m no different than that jacket you ve got on! y-y-or-or your stupid portal gun! i m just a tool! i-i m just an object! 
rick: hey, it s your choice to take it personally, morty. now for the love of god, be quiet! the point of this is to get the drop on the guy! 
morty: you know what rick, i ll tell you something! i m more than a human shield! 
rick: yeah, that s right! you are! you re a perfect impenetrable sheet of human armour, morty! because you re as dumb as i am smart! which is why when i say shut up it s really good advice. 
(morty tears up. a bunch of lobster-like aliens come out of the nearby corridors and surround them) 
rick: great, nice work, morty. 
(rick starts attacking and kicking the aliens. he kills the first wave, but more surround them quickly) 
rick: urrgh. 
(evil rick and evil morty emerge. evil rick is slow clapping) 
evil rick: ooh, look at you, c-137! you re-aren t you a tough customer? 
rick: the slow clap? really? kinda played out, dude. 
evil rick: not in this dimension it isn t. in fact, hah, i invented it and nobody else has ever even done it here before. 
rick: well lah-dee-dah.[slow claps] 
evil rick: hey, that s mine! 
[transition to rick and morty have been apprehended and are being carried down the corridor by lobster aliens] 
rick: i don t like the look of that rick, morty. we gotta escape. 
morty: i m not gonna help you, rick. y-you re a monster. 
rick: don t be rickdiculous, morty. 
morty: w-will you stop saying that? it s stupid. 
evil rick: take his morty away. 
evil morty: come with me. 
morty: yeah, gladly. geez man, ricks huh? 
(the two leave to the left. the view changes to another, smaller corridor, which the two walk down) 
morty: hey man, you seem to know how this place works. is there any way we can shut down that grid and rescue all those mortys out there? 
evil morty: it would be pointless. mortys have no chance of defeating a rick. 
(he opens a door) 
evil morty: in here. 
(as morty walks in, he sees it’s filled with a crowd of scared, shivering mortys. as he tries to leave, evil morty closes the door behind him, locking him in) 
[trans evil rick's lab]
(rick is tied to an examination table an array of computers and other devices are visible. many of the mortys from the outside of the dome are visible)
evil rick: ahh, isn t it beautiful? 
rick: yeah, yeah, looks like payday at neverland ranch in here. zing! 
lobster alien: hehehehehehehehehe. 
rick: that guy got it. 
evil rick: ah-ah rick, quiet. you re missing my symphony. 
(evil rick presses a button, allowing the sounds of the mortys in pain to come through. he conducts it for a bit) 
rick: hey, i ll take it over mumford and sons. zip! 
lobster alien: hehehehehehehehehe. 
rick: this guy is on it! 
evil rick: he s not laughing at your dumb jokes, rick. that s just a random noise it makes every ten seconds. 
lobster alien: hehehehehehehehehe. 
rick: awww. 
evil rick: see, rick, you re not as clever as you think you are. i wanted you to find me. we re not so[belch] different, you and i. 
(evil rick activates a display showing all the ricks from different timelines) 
rick: yeah, duh! 
evil rick: see this right here, rick? i crunched the numbers, i created a spectrum of all the ricks. i listed em out from most evil to least evil. here s where i am. and look at right here s where you are, rick. this guy right here? super weird. 
rick: i get it. so you want me to team up with you to take down the council of ricks, right? is that where you re going with this? cause that s where i d be going. 
evil rick: please. i think i m doing pretty good on my own. i m simply going to download the contents of your brain, and then kill you. 
[transition to rick’s garage. doofus rick is mixing chemicals and jerry is watching] 
doofus rick: okay, if we add a little more titanium nitrate, and just a tad of chlorified tartrate ovenless brownies! 
(jerry takes a brownie, eats it and smiles) 
jerry: it s incredible what a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order! 
doofus rick: well, come on, i can t take all the credit, jerry. it was your idea. c mere jerry! 
(both hug and laugh) 
jerry: hey, uh. c mere, uh. i-i wanna show you something. 
(they exit the garage and jerry pulls out a box, then opens it to reveal coins with r2d2s on them) 
jerry: okay, look. everybody makes fun of me for getting these, but you re a genius scientist, what do you think? there s little r2d2s where the george washingtons should be! 
doofus rick: you know jerry, i m not gonna tell you that these will increase in value, or even hold their current value. the truth is you bought em cause you like em. they have value to you. that s what matters. 
jerry: (tearing up) how long are you staying? 
doofus rick: until we find your rick. 
jerry: (hugging doofus rick) i found mine. i found mine. 
[transition to morty prison. c-137 morty is bashing at the door. he is approached by a group of mortys wearing robes and facepaint] 
morty c-137: help! 
religious morty: there is no escape, my son. we will find our peace in the next world. 
(religious morty offers c-137 a pamphlet titled “the good morty”) 
morty c-137: so what? y-y-y-y-you re just going to give up? 
religious morty: we re giving in to the power of the one true morty. one day he will return! 
all religious mortys: praise the one true morty! 
(morty opens “the good morty” to the first page, then scoffs and throws it away) 
morty c-137: alright mortys, listen up! my name is morty smith, from earth dimension c-137! i know you re scared, because i m scared, but that s no reason to accept our fate. we re mortys! we re not defined by our relationships to rick! our destiny is our own! 
morty 1: this sounds like something the one true morty might say. i m sick of being a human shield! i-i-i-i wanna be a gardener! 
morty 2: i wanna write really crazy, intense action novels! 
hammer morty: i m more than just a hammer! 
religious morty: he is the one true morty! the one true morty! 
all mortys: hooray! 
(the door opens, and a lobster alien walks in) 
lobster alien: hey, keep it down! 
all mortys: raaaaugh! 
(the mortys rush the door, breaking free and charging down the corridor) 
[transition to evil rick’s lab. evil rick is going through rick’s memories on a screen] 
evil rick: you ve lived quite a life, rick. it s a real shame you re not gonna be around to see it through. 
(the memories change theme to feature morty in each one. rick tears up) 
evil rick: you re crying? over a morty? 
rick: no, i m just allergic to dipshits. 
evil rick: ugh, pathetic. we both know that if there s any truth in the universe, it s that ricks don t care about mortys. 
(the mortys break through the door and rush at evil rick, killing the lobster aliens, surrounding him and tearing into him) 
evil rick: do your worst, you little bastards! kill me! do it! do it! 
(evil rick dies. morty c-137 appears and approaches rick) 
rick: morty! get me out of this! come on! 
morty c-137: you re lucky i m not a rick. 
(morty c-137 unbuckles rick from the examination table) 
rick: point taken, but this is[belches] no time for arcs. 
(he presses a button, disengaging the morty shield. mortys are released and pour down off the dome. rick grabs a phone and rings home) 
rick 1: yeah, hello? 
rick c-137: hey, what do me and o. j. not have in common? 
rick 1: huh? wh-who is this? 
rick c-137: i found the real killer, biitch! get over here! 
[transition to jerry and doofus rick are playing with legos. rick 1 opens the door] 
rick 1: yo ding-dong! we re done here. time to go. 
doofus rick: well jerry, i[belches] guess this means goodbye. 
jerry: w-w-well, does it have to? heh, you, you look just like rick. we could maybe you know get rid of him? i m not saying kill him, necessarily, i-i m also not saying necessarily not kill him, but- 
doofus rick: jerry. w-we both know it wouldn t work. it s time to go back to our lives. i love you, jerry. i love ya. 
(doofus rick hugs jerry and leaves. jerry makes as if to follow him, then stops and punches a wall. the lego castle they built falls apart) 
[transition to evil rick’s lab. the mortys are still fighting. ricks from the citadel move in and stop each morty, pulling them off evil rick’s corpse and bringing them back to the citadel] 
morty c-137: wh-wh-what s gonna happen to all these mortys? 
council rick 1: they ll go back to their families, attend school regularly, play video games, date girls poor little rickless bastards. 
[transition to citadel of ricks. the council has gathered around c-137 rick and morty] 
council rick 1: earth rick c-137, the council apologises for its false accusation. and in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake, we would like to compensate you with this voucher for a free replacement morty, in the event that[belches] your current[belches] morty should- 
rick: uh, guys? not a good time. come on, morty, let s hit it. 
(before they leave, rick takes the voucher anyway) 
[transition to citadel outside. rick and morty are walking away from the council] 
morty: is it time for arcs yet, rick? i did a pretty great job back there for a human cloaking device. saved your ass. 
rick: alright, morty, don t break an arm jerking yourself off. 
morty: man, i can t believe you, rick! that right there! tha-that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity. you know? to connect with me a little? 
rick: hey morty, you want connection? go be part of some stupid club like all those dumb ricks. you know, maybe i don t connect because i m the rickest rick there is. and you know, it would[belch] go without saying that the rickest rick would have the mortyest morty. 
morty: it would go without saying, huh? 
rick: yeah, it would. did you hear me say it? 
morty: nah (to himself) the mortyest morty 
rick: just don t get too big for your loafers, buster brown. a cocky morty could lead to some big problems. could be a real bad thing for everybody. 
morty: oh yeah, how s that? 
rick: i-i-i ll explain when you re older. 
[transition to evil rick’s lab. evil rick is lying in a pool of blood being inspected by ricks. for the damaged coda by blonde redhead starts playing in the background] 
rick 1: what a mess 
rick 2: pride cometh before the fall. i guess he got what he deserved. 
rick 1: what is that? 
(rick 1 turns evil rick’s head over to reveal wires) 
rick 2: hand me the laser defibrillator. 
doofus rick: hey guys! uh, c-can i help? 
rick 2: no! go clean the toilets! maybe you ll make friends with some turds! 
rick 1: you make us ashamed to be ourselves! 
(rick 2 removes the top of evil rick’s head to reveal electronics woven into his brain. they pull out a chip) 
rick 1: my god! i ve seen this technology before! this rick was being controlled remotely, puppeteered by somebody else. this is the receiver! 
rick 2: yeah, but where s the transmitter? 
[transition to citadel of ricks. mortys are being loaded into spaceships to be delivered to their respective dimensions] 
(evil morty follows them, and removes his eyepatch, revealing the transmitter. he crushes it underfoot and hides the wires, then follows the rest of the mortys) 
[credits play] 
[after credits scene jerry is sitting in rick’s bedroom, trying not to cry. rick enters] 
rick: wubbalubbadubdub! oh. hey jerry. wh-wh-what are you doing in my room, buddy? 
jerry: nothing! i was just, um, checking the smoke detectors. 
rick: alright. okay, get out. 
(jerry leaves and goes down to the dining room. he looks outside the window and sees doofus rick standing in the rain and smiles. rick appears beside jerry) 
rick: what s that dipshit doing out there? are you friends with him? you know he eats his own shit, right? oh my god, this is rich! i ve got like[belches] ten ricks to call right now!

(a portal opens behind them. rick and morty k-22 enter.) 
rick: oh, for fuck s sake. 
rick k-22: holding clipboard hello, i m rick k-22. this is my morty. (morty k-22 waves.) we re going from reality to reality asking ricks to contribute to the citadel of ricks redevelopment fund. 
rick: what are you, stupid? we re done with the citadel of ricks. i was burp never on board with it in the first place, that s why i murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot. 
rick k-22: examines clipboard ohhh. that was you. passes clipboard to his morty 
morty: they tried to murder him first. 
morty k-22: oh geez. well, you ll be happy to know that the council s gone now. 
morty: yeah, he knows. he murdered them. 
rick k-22: you wanna rein in your morty? 
rick: glaring every day. 
morty k-22: reading from script the citadel of ricks redevelopment fund donates-- 
rick k-22: interrupts morty, he s not gonna belch donate. you re pitching the policeman s ball to a black teenager here. pulls out his portal gun and shoots a new portal let s go. 
(morty k-22 waves and walks through the portal.) 
rick: you don t have to be a dick. 
rick k-22: i think you know that s not true. 
(rick k-22 also exits through the portal, which disappears.) 
morty: geez. i didn t know there were still ricks and mortys living on the citadel. i wonder what their day-to-day lives are like. 
rick: straps harpoon gun to his back well you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to atlantis. shoots a portal anyone continuing to explore the citadel is either stupid or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas. 
(rick exits through the portal.) 
morty: man. glad i m not one of them! 
(morty fixes his scuba gear and runs through the portal after rick.)

(we’re shown a montage. the citadel, still undergoing construction after the damages from the events of “the rickshank rickdemption”, is full of damaged buildings and roadways. cars, both flying and standard, are traveling.) 
(a large crowd of ricks with mortys interspersed throughout walks down a street.) 
(ricks work in a construction crew, rebuilding damaged structures.)

(simple rick finishes a present for his beth and wraps it.) 
narrator: his name is simple rick, but he s no dummy. 
(view from a handheld video camera. simple rick films beth blowing out candles on her birthday cake.) 
narrator: he realized long ago that the greatest thing he d ever create was his daughter. 
young beth: i love daddy! 
(simple rick smiles and cries happily.) 
narrator: we captured that moment and run it on a loop through simple rick s mind. 
(simple rick, aged up, sits in his seat at the wafer factory, the above scene playing on a helmet in a loop. he’s attached to machinery that collects happy secretions from his brain.) 
narrator: and the chemical that makes his brain secrete goes into every simple rick s simple wafer cookie. (said wafer is displayed on-screen.) come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion. come home to simple rick s. 
[transition to news room] 
(the broadcast resumes.) 
rick d716: just one day remains before our newly democratic citadel elects its first president. it s anyone s race among the rick candidates. 
(rick candidates are displayed on screen. they include retired general rick, private sector rick, juggling rick, rick guilt rick, and reverse rick outrage.) 
rick d716-b: but a certain other candidate should be getting at least one vote for most adorable. 
(candidate morty visits hospitalized mortys for photo ops.) 
rick d716 voiceover: that s right, the morty party candidate s still in the race, and you just gotta love him for that. 
(candidate morty stands outside a van, waving to press.)

candidate morty: i feel pretty confident about tonight s debate. 
campaign manager morty: you shouldn t, sir. you should be terrified. 
candidate morty: maybe you should find a little faith, young man. 
(candidate morty walks away and campaign manager morty calls after him.) 
campaign manager morty: you don t pay me to have faith! and we re the same age! 
[transition to morty pride parade] 
(a parade of mortys marches down the street. many mortys hold signs. there are a few ricks among the spectators. cop rick watches from outside cafe sanchez, drinking a coffee. a police cruiser pulls up, nearly hitting two mortys who run out of the way just in time. it stops in front of cop rick and the passenger window rolls down, revealing cop morty behind the wheel.) 
cop rick: oh! s-sorry, i was expecting-- 
cop morty: a rick partner? lesson 1, rookie expect the unexpected. now get in. 
(cop rick climbs into the passenger seat. cop morty starts the cruiser and drives slowly as they approach a cluster of mortys. one morty jumps against the hood of the car.) 
morty: mortys are human! 
cop morty: get the fuck off the car you rickless fuckin animal! 
(he pulls a lever and the car sends a taser shock through morty, who falls aside. the mortys disperse and cop morty resumes driving.) 
cop morty: the election s got these yellow shirts more riled up than a picture day jessica. 
cop rick: that s pretty harsh, sir. 
cop morty: so report me. nobody gives a fuck. 
cop rick: look, i m just saying. makes me a little sad to hear a morty cop calling mortys animals . 
cop morty: well, it makes me sad to see another rick cop buying into his sensitivity training. 
cop rick: well, i m glad to know there s more like me. 
cop morty: oh, there was one. why do you think that seat was empty? 
(a holographic rick appears on the dashboard.) 
dispatch: robbery at fifth and burp avenue. 
(dispatch vanishes.) 
cop rick: fifth and burp ? that s mortytown. 
cop morty: (to dispatch) unit 7 responding.

teacher rick: i love being your new morty. 
students: i love being your new mor... 
slick: (substituting for the word morty) farty! 
(slick and the other students laugh. teacher rick approaches his desk.) 
teacher rick: very amusing, mr. smith. almost as amusing as when your first rick was decapitated on zorpathion 9. (slick s smug face becomes downcast.) or was that your third rick? how many ricks have you had? 
slick: five 
teacher rick: i see. so you are top of the class in something. (all the mortys besides slick laugh.) tomorrow you will be transferred to your new ricks. hopefully they will be your last. yes, slow ri--tall morty? 
tall morty: di-did i gragitate this time yet? 
teacher rick: anything s possible, tall morty. ugh 
(the other mortys laugh again. the bell rings, and everyone but slick, lizard morty, fat morty, and glasses morty leaves the classroom.) 
lizard morty: guess we won t be seein each other after this, huh? 
slick: i say we make our last day count. i say we go to the wishing portal. 
glasses morty: that s a myth. 
fat morty: it s not a myth! mmmy first rick s fourth morty knew a rick whose morty went there. 
lizard morty: if we re not here for graduation, our butts are gonna end up in mortytown. 
slick: i thought your last rick fused you with a lizard, not a chicken. 
lizard morty: okay, fine. i m in. 
glasses morty: me too.

[transition to simple rick’s wafer cookie factory] 
(various factory drone ricks stand in position on an assembly line, processing the wafer cookies. rick j-22’s job is to stamp each wafer with the simple rick’s logo. suddenly an alarm blares, and the workers all look up to where supervisor rick is standing.) 
supervisor rick: whistles listen up, fucknuts! i ve been your supervisor for five years but all shitty things must come to an end, and i have been promoted to regional manager. (factory ricks cheer unenthusiastically.) yeah, i feel the same way. may we never meet again. of course that makes the position of supervisor available. (rick j-22 looks hopeful.) so as of next week, the ass you ll be kissing will be that of (rick j-22 smiles) k-83, (he frowns again) affectionately known as cool rick. 
(cool rick walks up and flips the workers off.) 
cool rick: i know i m new to the citadel and some of you might not think i ve put in my time, but what can i say? i m cool rick! finger guns yo, ha-ha-ha, check me out! 
supervisor rick: alright, knuckle- burp -heads, any questions? (rick j-22 raises his hand.) alright then, back to work, you gold-rickers. 
(supervisor rick and cool rick walk away. the assembly line restarts.) 
[transition to mortytown] 
(the cop cruiser goes down the streets of mortytown, where out-and-down mortys view it with suspicion.) 
cop morty: no ricks, no families, high off their asses and runnin amok. mortys are raised to be sidekicks. without a side to kick, they just start kickin . 
[ext. morty mart] 
(morty mart morty speaks to cop rick and cop morty about the robbery. cop rick takes down notes. behind morty mart morty, a purple morty with an alien mutation mops the floor) 
morty mart morty: they were, they were about my height, around fourteen years old oh! their shirts were yellow! 
cop morty: sarcastically yeah, make sure you get that down. 
cop rick: any mutations? augmentations? three eyes, a tail, maybe a buzzcut? 
morty mart morty: no, just four normal mortys. 
purple morty: normal ? 
morty mart morty: put it in your blog. 
cop morty: looking at two mortys in a nearby alley lemme turn over a few rocks. 
(cop morty approaches the two street mortys as they spraypaint the alley wall.) 
cop morty: aw geez, hey, what s goin on, fellas? 
morty 1: aw geez, man, nothin man, we re just hangin out and stuff. 
cop morty: i hear that, ah geez, i guess i m supposed to be figuring out who robbed the store across the street but aw geez i dunno. 
morty 2: smirking ah geez man, that sucks that your rick s makin you do that. 
cop morty: angered he s not my rick. he s my partner. aw geez. 
morty 1: well, maybe the uniform makes a big difference. who am i to say? to me, you just look like a sidekick. 
(cop morty snaps in a fit of rage and pins morty 1 to the wall, shoving a large gun in his mouth.) 
cop morty: call me a sidekick one more time. call me a sidekick! 
morty 2: hey man! c mon, aw geez! 
(cop rick looks on, seemingly uncertain what to do.) 
cop morty: wanna see how i paint a wall? 
morty 2: it was the mortytown locos, man! the mortytown locos! 
(cop morty releases morty 1. both street mortys flee. cop morty walks back to the cruiser.) 
cop rick: do you realize how many codes you just violated? 
cop morty: aw geez, rick. what do i know about knowin stuff? get in the fucking car. 
[transition to presidential debate] 
(the five rick candidates and candidate morty stand at podiums.) 
retired general rick: more lasers. 
moderator rick: you can take more time to answer the question if you d like. (silence.)... okay, juggling rick. how would you solve the citadel s financial crisis? 
juggling rick: first off, can i just say that i think this citadel is the greatest in the entire multiverse. now, i believe the answer to your question has three parts. (he reveals he s holding three balls.) first, education spending must get muuuch higher! starts tossing one ball 
[int. behind the scenes] 
(behind the scenes, campaign manager morty watches the debate on a screen.) 
juggling rick: but it has to be balanced with defense! starts juggling all three balls whoa! 
campaign manager morty: can we fact-check this, please? never mind, who am i kidding? this race is over. 
juggling rick: now juggling three balls and a chainsaw, he catches them all gracefully and that s how you run a citadel. bows 
(ricks and mortys in the audience cheer.) 
moderator rick: candidate morty. the number of displaced mortys is soaring, while rick satisfaction levels are plummeting, and the divide between the two groups has never been wider. smirks solve that one real quick. 
(the audience laughs, but candidate morty looks calm.) 
candidate morty: i don t see a divide between ricks and mortys. 
retired general rick: oh, shocker. farts 
reverse rick outrage: i d like to offer a rebuttal. farts 
rick guilt rick: gentlemen, gentlemen! i think we can all agree on one thing. farts twice well, came out as two things, but you get the idea. 
(all laugh but candidate morty.) you guys finished? (continues his speech.) the division i see is between the ricks and mortys that like the citadel divided, and the rest of us. i see it everywhere i go. 
(candidate morty’s voice can be heard as other scenes are shown.) 
candidate morty: i see it in our schools, where they teach mortys we re all the same because they re threatened by what makes us unique. 
(slick, glasses, lizard, and fat morty sneak out of the school through a window.) 
candidate morty: i see it in our streets, where they give guns to mortys so we re too busy fighting each other to fight real injustice. 
(cop rick and cop morty drive up to bust the mortytown locos.) 
candidate morty: i see it in our factories, where ricks work for a fraction of their boss s salary, even though they re identical and have the same iq. the citadel s problem isn t homeless mortys or outraged ricks. the citadel s problem is the ricks and mortys feeding on the citadel s debt. 
(rick j-22 works at his post in the wafer factory, but becomes enraged, breaks off a piece of machinery to use as a weapon, and enters supervisor rick’s office, where he’s watching the debate. he shoots supervisor rick to death.) 
rick j-22: holy shit. 
(as the factory goes into lockdown, rick j-22 enters the flavor chamber and uses simple rick as a hostage.) 
candidate morty: but i ve got a message for them, from the ricks and mortys keeping it alive. a message from the ricks and mortys that believe in this citadel to the ricks and mortys that don t you are outnumbered! 
(debate audience bursts into applause.) 
[int. backstage] 
campaign manager morty: holy shit. (candidate morty walks backstage.) i don t believe it! i-i can t believe it! 
candidate morty: i know. puts a hand on his shoulder that s why you re fired. walks away 
(campaign manager morty looks downcast. he’s approached by juggling rick.) 
juggling rick: sounds like you re looking for work. i can offer you a very enticing compensation package. sets down bag and unzips it, pulling out three juggling clubs first, let s talk benefits. 
[transition to int. flavor core] 
(rick j-22 paces in the chamber he shares with simple rick while a rick swat team stands outside.) 
simple rick: mumbling to self daddy loves you that s daddy s good girl. 
rick j-22: to simple rick your life is a lie, man. to police all your lives are lies! don t you get it?! they told us we were special because we were ricks but they stripped us of anything that made us unique! 
negotiator rick: through megaphone we know how you feel. we re working stiff ricks just like you, but our assembly line is justice. what are your demands? 
rick j-22: burp i-i-i want a portal gun. unregistered, untraceable, with enough fluid to take me off this goddamn prison! 
swat team rick: the media s outside. 
negotiator rick: well keep em there! 
[transition to ext. simple rick’s wafer cookie factory] 
(cn correspondent rick d716-c reports on the scene.) 
rick d716-c: anyway, so yeah, the suspect says the citadel is a lie built on lies and some other shit. (now sharing the screen with rick d716 and rick d716-b.) i say, appreciate the life you have, because it can always be worse. back to you, ricks. 
rick d716: thank you, rick 716-c. mumbling to d716-b that fuckin guy. 
rick d716-b: tell me about it. 
[transition to newsroom] 
rick d716: ahem. meanwhile in election news, an unexpected turn of events as morty from the morty party soars to the top of the polls. 
[transition to press conference] 
(candidate morty approaches a podium while reporter ricks call out to him.) 
candidate morty: yes? 
reporter rick: morty! what s your original reality and where s your rick? 
candidate morty: gosh. we moved around so much it s hard to remember. i see every rick as my rick. 
[transition to barroom] 
(the press conference is on the bar tv. campaign manager morty watches.) 
candidate morty: i hope they see me as their morty. 
campaign manager morty: holding glass another, please, with less water. 
bartender morty: fixing a new drink hey, cheer up, pal! a morty s gonna be president. gestures to tv imagine this kisser gettin blamed for everything! 
(bartender morty walks away. campaign manager morty takes a drink.) 
campaign manager morty: i guess i shoulda had more faith. 
(investigator rick is sitting a few seats down the bar.) 
investigator rick: it s not faith you need. it s fear. 
(investigator rick takes out a dossier from inside his trenchcoat and slides it over to morty, who takes it uncertainly.) 
campaign manager morty: what s this? 
investigator rick: drains his glass it s secrets. wh-wh-what do you think it is? gets up and walks away look at how i m dressed. 
rick reporter on tv: taking on the system like this, are you afraid at all for your safety? 
(campaign manager morty pulls out the documents in the dossier and looks them over.) 
candidate morty on tv: i d rather live in hope than fear. (campaign manager morty looks shocked at the documents, then looks up at the tv.) if i had to fear anything, i d fear other people being afraid. of fear. itself. 
[transition to int. mortytown locos hideout] 
(the mortytown locos sit around a tv watching the press conference while their rick prepares bootleg portal fluid in a setup similar to a meth lab.) 
candidate morty on tv: but no, i m not afraid. 
mortytown loco: hey rick, man, when there s a morty president, you gonna lick my balls or what? 
(other mortys laugh.) 
bootleg rick: shit, grandson, you keep me peelin squap-squams and slippin nib-nibs i ll lick whatever ain t nailed down. 
(mortytown locos laugh and high-five. suddenly the front door is kicked in. cop morty and cop rick enter with guns drawn.) 
cop rick: hands in the air! 
(all the mortys stand and raise their hands.) 
mortytown loco: what the hell, man? what the hell in hell? 
(cops enter the building, guns still drawn.) 
cop morty: you guys doin a little chemistry homework with grandpa? 
cop rick: is this what i think it is? 
cop morty: bootleg portal fluid. 
(bootleg rick grabs his portal gun and tries to escape, but upon making contact with the faulty portal, he disintigrates.) 
cop morty: guess his math was off. search the place. 
(cop rick goes further into the building while cop morty subdues the mortytown locos. rick enters a bedroom with his gun drawn only to encounter a weeping psychopath morty.) 
psychopath morty: a-are you m-my new rick? 
(cop rick lowers his gun and approaches morty.) 
cop rick: it s okay, morty. 
(he picks up psychopath morty to carry him to safety. psychopath morty pulls out a blade and stabs rick in the shoulder. cop rick falls to his knees and shoots psychopath morty. cop morty runs to the room.) 
cop morty: jesus! 
cop rick: he stabbed me! he got me bad, morty. 
cop morty: approaches rick and kneels down beside him shh, it s okay, you re okay. 
cop rick: you were right cough everything i learned in the academy was-- 
cop morty: it doesn t matter. helps rick to his feet nothing s wrong with putting your faith in a morty. you just gotta pick the right one. 
cop rick: why is there a crib in here? 
cop morty: just somethin they do to make you feel bad. 
(in the front room, the mortytown locos have their hands cuffed and legs shackled.) 
cop rick: boy, i got us knee-deep in paperwork, huh? 
cop morty: go to the car and grab a medipack. lemme worry about this. 
(cop rick goes outside to treat his stab wound. cop morty walks out of the building moments later as it disintegrates in a greenish blast, killing the mortys inside. cop morty gets to the cruiser.) 
cop rick: what happened? 
cop morty: same old story. mortys killing mortys. 
(morty gets in the car. rick stands pensively by the wreckage.) 
(a giant yellow head flies through space toward earth. the earth catches fire and land masses start collapsing as the wind picks up.) 
(a man takes a golf swing in the middle of the storm. a large piece of land drops out in front of him, leaving a large hole.) 
man: hey, golf is easy now! 
(the hole gets larger and the man falls in.) 
man: aahh! golf is hard again! golf is hard agaaaaaaain! 
(a news anchor in a raincoat, terry, is downtown with people panicking in the background as the giant head stares blankly at earth. a news title says “armagheaddon?!”.) 
terry: the view here is the same as yours, jim. a giant head has entered earth s gravity, triggering climate change and natural disasters we thought were impossible for at least another eight years. 
jim: (in news studio) let s not make this political, terry. do we know what this giant head wants? 
(giant head clears its throat, creating a large wind blast) 
giant head: show me what you got. 
(winds pick up and the tides change rapidly with its speech) 
terry: jim, you heard static said, show me what you got. 
giant head: show me what you got. i want to see what you got. (lamp post falls over, terry runs out of frame) 
(rick turns off the tv, they are on the couch) 
rick: oh boy. time to go, morty. 
morty: uhh, where? 
(rick puts on sunglasses) 
rick: the pentagon. i mean, not the pentagon. burp the lame one, here on earth. 
(rick and morty walk out of frame) 
[intro] 
(at the house, winds still blow strongly. summer, beth and jerry are standing outside.) 
summer: is it god? if it s god, do we get out of school? 
beth: it s not god, summer. 
jerry: she s allowed to think it s god if she wants, honey! 
beth: shut up, jerry. 
jerry: ok 
(rick and morty pull out of the garage in the ship.) 
beth: dad, what do you know about this? 
rick: morty and i are going to look into it. you guys hold tight. 
(they fly off) 
(mr. goldenfold arrives on a moped.) 
mr goldenfold: scary stuff, huh? pretty freaky. hi, i m morty s math teacher. i m also part of the street team inviting folks to the church downtown so we can pray together. 
beth: how is praying going to help? 
mr goldenfold: ma am, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather. did you wanna play checkers? let s be rational! i ll see you at god s house! (leaves) 
(pentagon war room, everyone is arguing) 
president: gentlemen, gentlemen, one at a time! simon? 
simon: seti, norad, and every broadcaster on the planet are attempting to show this being what humanity s got. string theory, world history, the human genome. 
(nathan slams fist on table) 
nathan: have you tried sending it launch codes? mr. president, what america s got is 70, 000 megatons of kaboom-boom! and i say we show it right up this floating head s ass! 
(argument begins again. a portal appears and rick and morty step through.) 
guards: hold it! don t move! (they approach rick and morty with guns) 
rick: stay back! this watch turns people into snakes! 
(guards stop and look at nathan for approval. nathan nods at them, and the guards aim. a laser fires at the guards and they disappear, leaving only snakes.) 
president: stand down. everybody stand down! i m the leader of these people and i m unarmed. there s no need for any more snake-makery. 
rick: my name is rick sanchez. this here s my grandson morty. (drinks from flask) 
everyone: hi, morty. 
morty: hey. 
rick: i ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we ve got here is a cromulon from the cygnus-5 expanse. so you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math. (points to viewscreen showing floating head) this head won t go away until burp earth shows them it s got a hit song. 
everyone: seriously, that s impossible, etc 
simon: you mean like vivaldi? 
rick: no, frasier. a live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. the cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms. 
president: all right, all right. thank you, mr. sanchez. change of plan, people. get me pharrell, randy newman, billy corgan, and the-dream. (no one responds) the-dream? he wrote umbrella and single ladies ? you people haven t heard of the-dream? 
rick: you re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at area 51. 
nathan: how do you know about that? 
president: for god s sake, nathan, the man turns people into snakes. he can use google maps. 
aide: sir! pharrell, newman, corgan, and that dream guy. they re all dead. 
president: what? how is that possible? do people just die when i name them? 
aide: the grammys, sir. there was an earthquake and all the musicians... (sniffs, holding back tears) all the famous ones, they re gone. 
president: dear god. 
aide: hold on, sir, just a minute. ice-t survived. he s inbound on an f-15, eta two hours. 
rick: good luck, mr. president. 
simon: sir, the magnetic poles are about to reverse. in two hours, there may not be an earth to save. 
(rick opens a portal) 
president: sanchez! are you a musician? 
rick: i dabble, mr. president. 
president: get this man and his grandson on a blackhawk to area 51. 
(at the church, everyone is panicking.) 
father bob: people! everyone! remain calm! every crisis of faith is an opportunity for more faith! when god deals you an 11, you don t fold! you double down, and always hit on a soft that means you, jews. 
jew: i beg your pardon, pastor, but the last i looked outside, it seems to be you that s been dealt the weak hand. jews rule! (no one responds) nobody? ok, tough church. 
principal vagina: hi, principal vagina. the name s real, possibly scandinavian. i m just gonna come out and make this pitch. the old gods are dead. f all previous existing religions. all hail the one true god, the giant head in the sky. 
(everyone reacts) 
principal vagina: ah, di di di di. (to bob) bob, bob, i get it. but unless this (holds up a necklace with a cross) can beat that what have you done for me lately? (tosses necklace to bob) so if you wanna excuse me, i m going out on the sidewalk and dropping to my knees and pledging my eternal soul to the thing that literally controls the f ing weather! (walks out) outta my way! 
pastor bob: ok, if sanity s been restored to this assembly, i d like to talk about the cost of repairing our new organ. sally, the plate, please. 
mr goldenfold: (holds up a dollar) ohhhh, this is my favorite part! 
[helicopters over the desert subtitle nevada desert]
(restricted air space. rick and morty are on a helicopter) 
morty: rick, are you really a musician? 
rick: who s not a musician, morty? 
morty: me! 
rick: yeah, not with that attitude. 
jump master: we re in the drop zone! i m the jump master! my name s jamey! with an e-y! go, go, go! (rick slides down rope) 
morty: b-b-but we don t have a song! 
(outside the church, principal vagina is on the sidewalk on his knees) 
principal vagina: giant head in the sky, please forgive all that we ve done. we re sorry for increased levels of emissions and our racism. and of course, the amber alerts i keep ignoring on my phone. 
(at area 51 speaker system, rick and morty slide down rope out of helicopter) 
rick and morty: whooooooooahhhh!!!! 
(they land on a stage with various live performance equipment on it. the yellow cromulon is in front of the stage staring.) 
rick: (picks up a microphone) all right, morty, let s get ready to do it! why don t you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat? 
morty: rick, i think we need to cut our losses. we get our family and portal out of here! 
rick: morty! good music comes from people who are relaxed. just hit a button, morty! gimme a beat! 
morty: oh man, ok, all right, um 
(morty presses a key and a beat starts, rick knocks over a mic stand and starts “singing”) 
rick: ahhhhh yeahhhhh 
ya gotta get schwifty (morty starts beating a tambourine in rhythm) 
ya gotta get schwifty in here it’s time to get schwifty (the president and nathan are watching the performance on a screen inside) 
nathan: get schwifty? what the hell is that? 
president: it s our world s best effort, that s what. 
rick: take off your pants and your panties. shit on the floor. time to get schwifty in here i'm mr. bulldops
nathan: mr. bulldops? 
president: don t analyze it, nathan. it s working! 
rick: take a shit on the floor 
time to get schwifty in here (weather starts to die down around the world) 
(at the church) 
pastor bob: and third-level donors get our all access family pass. 
summer: listen! the storm is stopping! 
(on the stage) 
rick: hey, take your pants off 
it’s schwifty time today (song ends) 
giant head: hmmmm. 
(everyone at area 51 waits in anticipation) 
(at the church) 
principal vagina: please be kind to us for we are but tiny things with entire bodies stuck to your ground. 
(at the stage) 
giant head: i like what you got. good job. 
(giant head flies away) 
(everyone at area 51 cheers and celebrates) 
(at the church, everyone lifts principal vagina, “what do you know, he was right! hooray principal vagina!”) 
beth: now hold on a second, let s be rational about this. 
(everyone stops and stares at beth) 
beth: no, i m i m just saying, we don t know if there s a cause-effect relationship-- 
(earthquake hits, beth falls on ground) 
beth: oh, god, what s going on now? 
(at the stage, rick and morty and area 51 panic) 
(the earth is surrounded by an energy field and disappears. earth reappears in another galaxy with four other planets, a disco ball-like sun, and several different-colored cromulons looking at earth.) 
(at area 51) 
president: what the hell happened? 
aide: mr. president, you re gonna wanna see this. 
rick: i think planet earth has just been transported. 
(at the church) 
principal vagina: the head has left and sent its children! 
beth: holy crap! 
(everyone gets on their knees) 
summer: oh dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion! it will never happen again! 
(everyone starts murmuring prayers) 
(at area 51) 
simon: sir, we ve started picking up on a garbled signal. we re decrypting it now. 
(screen gradually descrambles) 
(screen shows different bands of different aliens on different stages. dance music plays in the background as the cromulon narrates.) 
cromulon: we asked them to show us what they got. and they did. now we ll see which of them has got the most. 24 hours, five planets, five songs. but in the end, there can only be one. planet music! all participation is involuntary. disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray. 
rick: uhh, it s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead. 
act 2 (dance music plays, planet music opening shows) 
cromulon: welcome back to planet music! first up, let s hear the latest song from planet parblesnops. the greebybobes! show me what you got. 
greebybobe: hold it, hold it, stop! music isn t about competition or captivity! if you love music, you love freedom. let these worlds be free, please! 
cromulon: disqualified! 
(plasma ray powers up and fires at the planet, blowing it up) 
cromulon: there s one every season. moving on to planet arbolez meterosos. arbolian meterososians. show us what you got. 
arbolian meterososian: ah two, three, four 
(the arbolian meterososians play a very simple and underwhelming song while looking at the cromulons for approval.) 
(at area 51. rick, morty and ice-t are in a studio with several instruments. rick is playing a bass, morty is poking at a keyboard, and ice-t is in the corner. the aide comes in.) 
aide: rick, morty, ice-t. the timetable s moved up. earth s on in six hours. 
morty: like we re not already under enough pressure! (morty flips a bowl of peanuts at the aide and it hits him in the head. the aide leaves.) 
rick and ice-t: whoa ho ho ho ho! 
rick: geez, morty. the guy s just doing his job. take it easy. 
morty: rick, ice-t, could you guys take it less easy?! we ve got six hours to come up with a song! 
rick: genius happens in the moment, morty. (walks over to keyboard) 
morty: well, can we at least go get our family? you know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose? 
rick: that s planning for failure, morty. even dumber than regular planning. (presses a button on the keyboard) balls. 
(morty walks toward the portal gun) 
rick: morty, morty, stop! listen! there s only so much charge left in this thing. if we portal home from here and back, we re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. get it? 
morty: what?! 
rick: yeah, burp you see, i try to shelter you from certain realities, burp morty. cause if i let you make me nervous, then we can t get schwifty. 
morty: stop saying it like it s a thing! you made it up! 
rick: hey, morty! could you lick my (rick presses keys on the keyboard with the sample of him saying balls ) 
(the president, nathan, and his aide are watching them through a window) 
morty: rick, cut it out! that s not funny, rick! 
nathan: i ve seen enough. these guys are one-hit wonders. 
president: and what s your plan, general? 
nathan: we still have the nuclear option. on my word, we can launch a nuclear missile at every one of those heads in the sky. 
president: our planet s held captive on a live game show and your solution is to shoot the audience? you can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, general. until then, i ll put mine in rick and morty. get schwifty was a jam. 
(in field outside church, everyone is dressed in robes wearing head hats. principal vagina is holding a homemade satellite on a stick with an earbud) 
principal vagina: hello? yes sir, yeah. thank you sir, thank you. he says he s proud of what we re doing and hopes we have a great ascension festival! happy ascension! 
all: happy ascension! 
(jerry is holding an ice cream cone, beth looks unimpressed.) 
beth: we should pack up and leave town now. 
jerry: i think it s inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. if you d stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself. 
(summer arrives wearing a head hat, holding two head hats. beth double-facepalms.) 
jerry: whoa! look at you! you re wearing the hat and everything! 
summer: here s yours! (puts hat on jerry) mom, do you mind if i cook dinner tonight? 
beth: yeah, sure. wait, what?? 
summer: i love you guys. you gave me life. and it s the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents. 
beth: dinner sounds nice. 
(ethan arrives.) 
ethan: pardon, mr. and mrs. smith. summer, are you coming to the ascension? 
summer: father, can we please go to the ascension? 
jerry: sure! let s go to the ascension. wh-wh-what is it? 
(three people are each tied to a bunch of balloons, tethered to a stake in the ground. one is labeled “thief”, another labeled “goth”, and the third labeled “movie talker”.) 
principal vagina: we hereby send these un-wantables skyward that they might be inhaled by the many heads, later to be sneezed back to us as better babies! (cuts first rope) headward, free now to rise. (cuts second rope) headward, free now to rise. (cuts third rope) headward, free now to rise. 
summer: oh yes, yes! rise to the giant head! you are free to be free! 
(in the studio) 
ice-t: a squeegee comes up from the garage, right? and he s got a lobster in one hand and movie tickets in the other. he s like, i m ready! 
(rick and ice-t laugh) 
ice-t: who would take a lobster to see iron man 3? 
(rick and ice-t laugh) 
ice-t: aw, damn. we re out of original flavor fig newtons. i should get going anyway. 
rick: wait, wait, wait! come on, h-hold on a second! 
(rick grabs the portal gun, hits a couple buttons, makes a portal in the floor and drops through it. another portal appears in the ceiling and rick drops out of it with several snacks.) 
morty: what?! 
ice-t: damn. you didn t tell me you f around with portals and shit. 
morty: that s it! 
(morty grabs the portal gun and gets up.) 
rick: whoa, whoa! morty! give me that! 
morty: you lied! you lied about the charge! you were just being lazy! get back! sit down! 
rick: morty, just put it down. you don t know what you re doing. 
(morty turns to a wall and fires a portal.) 
morty: i m going to go find mom and dad. 
rick: nooooo! 
(morty jumps through the portal and rick tries to grab him, but the portal closes.) 
rick: ahhhh, sh ! 
president: ah, sh . 
(morty steps through different portals to different worlds, ending up in buttworld.) 
morty: ahhh, sh . 
(outside of the smiths’ home, summer, beth and jerry are hoeing the front yard.) 
summer: and then ethan played guitar and we learned the seven contemplations of the head by singing them. it was really fun. praise be the head! 
jerry and beth: praise be the 
jerry: yeah. 
(principal vagina arrives on a bicycle with a seat, bell ringing.) 
principal vagina: hi folks, head priest vagina. thanks for farming all those potatoes. it s 6 p. m., so if you re a parent, you re now entitled to adoration from your children. 
summer: i m going to start dinner! (walks into the house) 
beth: i don t know what to say. summer is doing really well here. 
jerry: she s aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become. 
(someone tied to balloons floats by in the background with label “inappropriate joke teller”.) 
beth: she s not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfew 
balloon man: please help me! you can reach me if you try. please help me!! 
beth: that s not our business as long as summer is thriving! 
(inside the smiths’ house, summer serves dinner at the table.) 
summer: taco time! (summer pulls off the lid to reveal exactly 12 tacos.) i hope it pleases you as the head desires. 
beth: that s wonderful, summer! 
jerry: we re so proud of you. but honestly, you don t have to make dinner every night. 
summer: of course i do, silly! (gasps and drops lid) oh my god, daddy, i m sorry i called you silly! i m so sorry! (turns around and drops to knees) heavenly head and cranial creator! forgive my transgressions against family and community! may my chores complete me as i complete them! 
(summer sulks out of the dining room and up the stairs.) 
(morty stumbles out of a portal on a green world and collapses to the ground holding the portal gun. a figure looms over morty, pokes him with a stick, then rolls him over.) 
birdperson: morty. 
morty: birdperson? 
birdperson: you appear to be dying. i will make efforts to prevent this, but can promise nothing. 
(in the studio, rick plays with the keyboard and ice-t is in the corner on his phone.) 
rick: wh-what do you think, ice? probably a little over-developed. 
ice-t: shit. over-developed, under-developed. bad songs are bad songs. 
rick: well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or ? 
ice-t: ah, hell no, man. you do your thing, but i can t afford to get my pride wrapped up in your shame. you know what i m sayin ? 
rick: ice, i don t want to be a negative nelly or anything, but burp if morty doesn t come back with my portal gun and i eat it out there, it s, uh, kind of your problem too. 
ice-t: pfff. i ain t worried about no earth blowin up, man. 
rick: what? why not? 
ice-t: yo, this is why. 
(ice-t transforms into a floating ice shard with the same face.) 
rick: what the f ? you can turn into ice? 
ice-t: my story begins at the dawn of time in the far away realm of alphabetrium. there, every being is a letter of the alphabet. but i was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. earth is just one of the many stops on my lifelong journey with no destination. so you better believe i don t care if it blows up! cause i ll just be ice, floatin through space, like a comet! 
rick: take it from me, ice. burp you can t just burp float around space not caring about stuff forever. 
ice-t: pshhhh. man, watch me. good luck, rick. 
(ice-t blasts out of the ceiling of the studio.) 
president: ok, things are getting out of hand. i better make sure rick has everything he needs to get schwifty. 
nathan: oh, for god s sake, that s enough. 
(nathan pulls a gun on the president) 
president: what the hell are you doing, nathan? i m the goddamn president of the united f in states! 
nathan: i m setting the nuclear option to launch one minute into earth s performance. and you, mr. president, i hope you like being hit in the face with a gun! 
president: wait, wait, wait, why-why-- 
(nathan pistol-whips the president and he falls to the ground.) 
(at birdperson’s residence, birdperson serves morty a bowl of food and tinkers with the portal gun.) 
birdperson: i believe i can access the history of rick s gun and help you get back to him. 
morty: but can you help me get to my family? you know, at my house? 
birdperson: is your intention to abandon rick using his own portal gun? in bird culture, this is considered a dick move. 
morty: all of rick s moves are dick moves! wh-what am i eating? what is this, bird seed? 
birdperson: it is random debris. i found it in my carpet. i don t know what humans eat. 
(tammy arrives wearing a bathrobe.) 
tammy: you know what this human eats! 
birdperson: don t be gross, tammy. 
tammy: (leans over to morty and whispers) bird d . 
morty: tammy gross. birdperson, you always stick up for rick, but he doesn t care about anyone but himself. he doesn t think about the consequences of anything he does. 
birdperson: and as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds. and he is the reason you and i know each other. and the reason i m alive at all. 
(birdperson points to a wall of photos of himself and rick together. last shown is rick holding a baby.) 
morty: what s that? who s that baby? 
birdperson: morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from earth but had to abandon rick. i could give your loved ones shelter on birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers. how often do you think you might look up at the stars and wonder what might have been had you just put your faith in rick? 
(morty stands in thought for a moment. planet music starts back up on the tv.) 
cromulon: that was chunky tunk with full ming mong, empty gorp dorp. up next, planet earth! 
morty: oh god! we re up?!?! 
(at the church, principal vagina and other priests are talking with jerry and beth.) 
principal vagina: jerry and beth, your family is a golden example of what headism has to offer the world. 
beth: the world? 
principal vagina: headism is a hit. we re taking it worldwide and would like jerry to be our church s head of advertising. 
jerry: you would? 
principal vagina: beth, we d like to promote you from horse surgeon, straight past human surgeon, to head of medicine. 
beth: that s my dream! that s my dream. 
jerry: thank you. this is all so overwhelming, but, uh we can t. 
beth: absolutely not. 
principal vagina: i m sorry? 
beth: we ve been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us, but the key is, it has to be our daughter, not this person she s become. 
jerry: we ll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion. (turns and puts his hands on beth s shoulders) and you know what? i m sick of pretending that we re together because of the kids in the first place! i married you because you re the love of my life! 
beth: (puts her hands on jerry s sides) and i m lucky to have you and i never tell you that! you know, we will come out of this stronger as a family! 
cut: summer has tied beth and jerry to ropes and balloons outside.) 
beth: please don t do this, please don t do this! summer! 
jerry: summer, listen carefully. i stole a paper clip and i have it in my cheek but i don t know what to do with it and it hurts. 
summer: you re going to be ok! (ties another balloon to them) you will come back as babies! 
jerry: i am a baby! i m a baby now! 
(in the now empty studio, a portal opens up and morty steps through.) 
morty: hello? is anybody here? (looks through the studio window and sees the president tied up) mr. president! 
(morty darts out of the studio to the president and unties him. the president climbs up to the console and presses a button) 
president: this is bluebird. code tango-niner-alpha. abort launch. abort! hello? (releases button) he s blocked me out. 
morty: sir, i need to get to the stage and help rick get schwifty! 
president: it won t matter how schwifty you get, morty. the general s got nukes set to launch halfway through earth s song! 
morty: oh my god! c-c-can you fly a blackhawk? 
president: can the pope s d fit through a donut? 
morty: uhhh, i m not sure? 
president: exactly! 
(on the stage, rick stands before the cromulons.) 
cromulon: show me what you got. 
rick: ahem. (starts a low-key, bouncy song) uhhh lop-oo-lop-oo-lop-oo-dups, nop-oo-nop-oo-nop-oo-nuts. 
(outside the church, principal vagina is preparing to cut beth and jerry loose. the cromulons' faces become angry.) 
principal vagina: headward free now to rise! 
mr goldenfold: hey! look at the heads! looks like the heads are gettin angry! 
(in the desert, the president flies the helicopter clumsily to the stage with morty in tow.) 
president: i m really bad at this, morty! there are way too many buttons on this thing! 
morty: mr. president, if i ve learned one thing today, it s that sometimes, you have to not give a f ! 
(on the stage, rick continues his song.) 
rick: nup-oo-nup-oo-nup-oo-nups ooh, tough crowd. 
(outside the church, principal vagina is preparing to cut beth and jerry loose.) 
principal vagina: i m sure that has that has nothing to do with this. 
(principal vagina cuts the rope and the cromulons immediately start booing.) 
summer: the heads are displeased! (she jumps and grabs beth and jerry s legs.) 
ethan: summer! (he jumps and grabs her.) 
(on the stage rick continues his song as the blackhawk arrives. morty and the president slide down ropes out of the helicopter onto the stage.) 
rick: morty! 
(the cromulons begin cheering with “yay!” and “hooray!” etc. with smiles on their faces. the now unmanned helicopter crashes off frame.) 
(outside the church, summer and ethan are pulling beth and jerry down to the ground.) 
mr goldenfold: the heads love this! they love it when we don t kill the smith family! 
(the balloons are released, but beth and jerry are still tied up.) 
principal vagina: no! stop that! you re not allowed to interpret the will of the heads! 
(on the stage, the president grabs the microphone and speaks to the control room staff.) 
president: call off the nuclear strike! this is the president. stop the nuclear missile launch! 
nathan: just launch the missiles! 
(nathan smashes a button and two nuclear missiles emerge from the ground in the desert. the cromulons watch as the missiles fly toward the yellow cromulon and lay puny explosions on its chin.) 
cromulon: boo! not cool! 
(outside the church) 
principal vagina: i m the only one that speaks to the heads! 
(cromulon zooms in close to earth) 
cromulon: disqualified! 
mr goldenfold: the heads disqualified vagina! get him! 
(the mob runs toward principal vagina. the cromulon zooms closer.) 
(on the stage) 
cromulon: disqualified! disqualified! 
(the plasma ray points toward earth and begins powering up. the control room staff evacuates. the plasma ray heads right for the stage but something flies in the way and blocks it.) 
all: ice-t? 
(ice-t slowly crumbles from the plasma ray’s power) 
ice-t: that s right, it s me, ice-t! i care now! you made me care more! with all due respect, i d like to hear what rick and morty have to play. 
morty: what do you say, rick? 
rick: i say (grabs mic) let s do it! 
(morty presses a button on the keyboard and a different beat starts playing. the heads start with “hooray” etc while smiling. rick claps over his head and morty dances a little.) 
rick: all right! 
morty: ohhhh yeahhhh! 
rick: come on, here we go! 
morty: ohhhh yeahhhh! 
rick: say it with me! 
all: head bent over 
raised up posterior head bent over (ahh yeah) 
raised up posterior (outside the church, principal vagina is ties up with balloons and rope. a different person cuts the rope. vagina sees the heads smiling as he rises.) 
principal vagina: ohhh my gooooodddd!!! 
(on the stage) 
all: head bent over (yeah) 
raised up posterior (oh yeah) 
head bent over (oh yeah) 
(raised up posterior!) 
cromulon: after 988 seasons of planet music, the cromulons have decided to declare earth the final winner and bring our musical reality show to a conclusion. goodbye! 
(earth is transported back to the right place.) 
all: yeah, we did it! 
(outside the church, everyone is still and silent.)

morty: sure thing! and i was kinda hoping that i could get a selfie with you? 
(the president waves over secret service.) 
president: actually, if you try to tell anyone what happened here, we ll deny it and probably worse.

rick: trade secret, mr. president. particle beam in a wristwatch snake holster on the leg. 
(he pulls up his pant leg to reveal a holster which a snake crawls out of. the snake slithers away and a soldier whistles impressed. the president begins laughing and hugs rick.) 
president: i love this man!

beth: speaking of disasters, dad, we are leaving you in charge, here, 
rick: i know, c-can we wrap this up? morty and i have some synthetic laser eels oxidizing in the garage, 
beth: hey, don't blow me off, i am drawing a line, okay? any damage to this house or these children when we get back, and... n-no more adventures with morty, 
morty: aw, geez, rick, if my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time, 
both: that's right, 
jerry: wait, what? 
rick: listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine, and if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever, it's like that old song"blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop,"y-you guys know that song? from tiny rogerts? you never heard of it? you know, the black effeminate guy from the'50s? no-nobody? a-all right, whatever, look, who cares? just go on your stupid trip,

summer:[scoffs] 
rick: because i'm having a party, b-i-i-i-itch! 
morty: oh, what?! rick, you can't! 
summer: what do you mean you're having a party? are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something? 
rick:"glip glop?"you're lucky a traflorkian doesn't hear you say that, 
summer: is that like their n-word? 
rick: it's like the n-word and the c-word had a baby and it was raised by all the bad words for jews, 
morty: listen, i think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and-- 
summer: screw that, this is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids, 
rick: that's why you party? boy, you really are 17, 
summer: why do you party? 
rick: to get wr-wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son! 
summer: just keep your sci-fi friends away from my awesome ones, 
rick: yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes, 
captain: after dinner, titanic 2 will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg, and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths, 
jerry: a rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive, are you sure the ship will sink? 
captain: i can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before, it is un-unsinkable, ooh! 
jerry: look, it's the line for the bow! 
beth: jerry, i'd love to just kick back with a margarita and read, do you mind if i skip the whole"king of the world"bit? 
jerry: well, it's not the"king of the world"bit, that's jack and fabrizio, this is where rose says,"i'm flying, jack!"but whatever, i can be the only one to do it alone, 
beth: well, what about her? excuse me, ma'am, would you like to take my place in line? 
lucy: i, uh--i could get into trouble,

rick: morty, listen--we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax, 
morty: yeah, if i relax now, there might not even be any more adventures! 
rick: jesus, morty, you're bumming me out, can't we just pretend like everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later?

[ crashes ] 
rick: oh, great, who invited abradolph lincoler? 
summer: i thought everyone was welcome, 
rick: it's not the same, summer, lincoler is a crazed maniac--just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the dna of adolf hitler and abraham lincoln, turns out it just adds up to a lame, weird loser, 
lincoler: rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being, but i shall finally know peace when i watch the life drain from your wretched body! 
brad: whoa, what's up, man? 
lincoler: i have no quarrel with you, boy,

mr needful: ah, then perhaps you could make use of this, this microscope reveals things beyond comprehension, 
[ laughs ] 
rick:[laughs] 
[ laughs louder ] 
rick:[laughs louder] 
[ laughs louder ] 
rick:[laughs louder] 
summer: grandpa, go home and drink, 
[ swoop! ] 
jerry: why don't we do a model of the solar system? that's what my dad did with me when i was your age, 
morty: oh, okay, 
jerry: you know, rick's in his lab, making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science, a man and his boy, making planets, hey, how about we use a ping-pong ball for pluto? and then jupiter-- 
morty: uh, actually, i don't think pluto's a planet, 
jerry:[chuckles] of course pluto's a planet, son, i learned that in the third grade, 
morty: well, yeah, but you know they changed it, 
jerry: morty, nobody changed the planets, 
morty: i just googled it, pluto's not a planet, they changed it in 2006, 
jerry: yeah, i heard about that, morty, and i disagree, 
morty: you disagree? 
jerry: that's right, it's possible to disagree in science, morty, pluto was a planet, some committee of fancy assholes disagree, i disagree back, give me a ping-pong ball, 
morty: um, okay, i-i just have to 
jerry: go find rick and go over my head about pluto? 
morty: no, geez, i just got to go to the bathroom, damn, 
jerry: oh, okay, good, this is gonna be fun, 
rick: hey, morty, let me--let me--let me ask you a question real quick, does evil exist, and if so,-can one detect and measure it? 
morty: um... 
rick: rhetorical question, morty, the answer's"yes, you just have to be a genius,"cute, your sister's boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded, 
morty: ooh, oh, boy, rick, i'm don't think you're allowed to say that word, you know? 
rick: morty, i'm not disparaging the differently abled, i'm stating the fact that if i had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded, 
morty: okay, yeah, but i don't think it's about logic, rick, i think the word has just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they're doing the right thing, 
rick: well, that's retarded, 
jerry: what are you guys talking about? 
rick: apparently, nothing, 
jerry: you asked him if pluto's a planet, didn't you? 
morty: no! 
rick: it's not, 
jerry: shut up, rick, i don't care what anyone says, if i can be a planet, it can be a planet again, planet, planet, planet, planet, 
rick: stay scientific, jerry, 
goldenfold: this aftershave made women want me, but it also made me impotent! mr. needful a price for everything, mr, goldenfold, a price for everything,[laughs evilly] 
goldenfold: oh, my god! how could i not see this coming?![sobbing] my lust! my greed! i deserved this! 
rick: this serum should counteract the negative effects, 
goldenfold: holy cats! ladies, let's get out of here, i haven't learned a thing! 
rick: here, you can have this back, 
mr needful: you didn't use it? 
rick: sure i did--to develop this, it detects and catalogs all your"twilight zone,"ray bradbury,"friday the 13th"the series voodoo crap magic, i thought you might want it so you didn't accidentally sell anybody, say, a typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries and then makes the murders happen in real life? ooh, 
mr needful: be quite, 
rick: don't you want to make sure people know what they're getting? you're not intentionally selling, beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind? 
mr needful: i find this all quite preposterous, 
rick: oh, i say, good sir, oh, harrumph, oh, oh 
[babbles ] 
customer: that's beautiful, 
rick: you know it's gonna be wearing you in three hours? 
mr needful: do i need to call the police? 
rick: here, you can use my phone, don't worry, it won't make you deaf because i'm not a hack, you think you're[bleep] so great, you stupid piece of[bleep] shit, 
summer: stop! hey! stop it right now! grandpa rick, i like working here, 
rick: you work for the devil, 
summer: so what? 
both:"so what?" 
summer: yes, so what if he's the devil, rick? at least the devil has a job, at least he's active in the community, what do you do? you eat our food and make gadgets, buh-bye, 
rick: whoops, 
[ giggles ] 
summer: i'm sorry, mr, needful, i'll clean that up, i don't know what i can do about the ghost lady-that came out of it, but-- 
mr needful: it's fine, summer, you know, your grandfather's right, this store curses people, that's my business, 
summer: well, yeah, fast-food gives people diabetes, and clothing stores have sweatshops, is there a company hiring teenagers that isn't evil? this is my first job, you've been nice to me, mr, needful, you respect me, 
mr needful: please, call me"the devil," 
summer: i'd rather not 
mr needful: yes, perhaps not during business hours, 
jerry: i told you, i want to file a declaration that pluto is a planet, well, then my son's going to fail his science class, and when that happens, i'm suing you first, i think i know what the"a"in nasa stands for, 
morty: dad, what's your endgame? 
jerry: ain't no game, sucka, 
morty: why don't we just make the solar system with eight planets? it's even easier, 
jerry: sure, sure, and why don't we just burn galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round? science isn't always easy, morty, 
jerry: whoa! 
morty: whoa! 
jerry: what the hell?! 
[ both groaning ] [ ting! ] [ hisses, buzzes ] 
king flippy nips: i'm king flippy nips, ruler of pluto, we discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world, you really gave it to those guys at nasa, 
jerry: i was--you know, sometimes science is about conviction, king flippy nips it'd like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you, 
jerry: oh, i... 
king flippy nips: plutonians, jerry smith is a scientist from earth, where he's creating a model of our solar system, jerry, tell pluto about your decision, 
jerry:[clears throat] um... pluto's a planet, 
[ cheers and applause ] 
jerry: pluto's a[bleep] planet, bitch! 
morty: oh, man, this is definitely gonna go to his head, 
mr needful: if it's athletic prize you desire, principal vagina, i might--principal vagina i'll take it, 
mr needful: b-but i haven't even-- 
principal vagina: thank you very, very much, great store, great place, bye, 
mr needful: huh, okay, i must say, summer, i thought your grandfather's outburst would have disrupted business, but this is the best weekend i've had since salem, 
summer: nice,"wholesome delight"for lunch? 
mr needful: is that the vegan place? 
summer: yeah, i love their soup, 
mr needful: i'm kind of soup-ed out, mrs. tate, is it? what do you desire? whoa, whoa, slow down, honey, 
mrs tate: oh, is there a limit? everything's free, right? 
summer: let's just say you don't pay, with money, 
[ both chuckle ] 
mr needful: that was perfect, 
mrs tate: you pay with the curses, right? 
mr needful: um... i--well... but, mrs. tate, why do you want cursed items? 
mrs tate: well, i'm going to get the curses removed at"curse purge plus,"you know, the guy on tv? 
[ door closes ] 
mr needful: what? 
rick: have you acquired creepy specific old stuff from a mysterious antique or thrift store that gives you powers but[bleep] with you in unforeseeable ways? bring it to"curse purge plus,"i use science to un-curse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers, this guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster, but guess what? he would have had to run until he died, making them worthless, i removed the curse, making them worth, like, i don't know, 8 million, see you at the olympics, this eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family, now it does their taxes, everything's deductible, don't pay for cool stuff with your soul, pay for it with money, you know, like how every other store in the world works? we're located at first and main in old town, come on--come on down,"first and",[babbles]"needful things,"where you can get evil items for free! 
mr needful: diabolic son of a motherf-- 
plutonian interviewer: we're back on"good morning, pluto,"and a very good morning it is for our guest, earth scientist jerry smith, who's making headlines with his bold announcement that is what, jerry? 
jerry: pluto is a planet, 
plutonian interviewer: well, how about that, i love it, 
scroopy noopers: morty smith, i'm scroopy noopers, i'm a scientist, can i show you something? 
morty: uh, i better not, right now, 
[ blurp! ] 
scroopy noopers: the center of pluto, mr, smith, is made of a substance called"plutonium,"mines like these suck plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers, and the more we remove, the more pluto shrinks,[rumbles] there it goes again, just shrank a little, but a few years ago, your scientists noticed pluto had gotten so small they couldn't even call it a"planet"anymore, should've been our wake-up call, but the rich plutonians won't wake up, and they love your dad telling everyone pluto's a planet because that means they can keep mining until pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor, and finally[blows] 
morty: um, a party? 
scroopy noopers: is everyone in your family an idiot? 
morty: well, for sure me and my dad are, 
scroopy noopers: well, all you have to do is get him to admit that, and you could save four billion lives, 
morty: yeah, you know, the thing is my dad's really insecure, 
summer: hmm, funny, mr, needful, out of everything in the store, you'll never guess what we couldn't get rid of, 
[ sputtering ] 
summer: oh, my god, 
[ grunting ] 
summer: oh, my god, i wish this desk was lighter, i wish this knot was looser, 
[ grunts ] 
summer: come on,[blows] 
summer: i don't--wait, what am i doing? i wish i knew cpr, 
[ chokes, sputters ] 
mr needful: oh, jesus, what a waste of a monkey paw, 
summer: mr, needful, how could you even think of doing something so horrible? 
mr needful: i'm the devil, what should i do when i fail--get myself an ice cream? 
summer: you haven't failed, 
mr needful: people like rick are making me obsolete, i mean, seriously, i may be"the devil,"but your grandpa is the devil, i just want to go back to hell, where everyone thinks i'm smart and funny, 
summer: no! it's not fair, everyone in this town got something they wanted from you--even rick, i was your only friend, and i get nothing? 
mr needful: okay, i'll give you one thing, name it, 
summer: i want to help you, 
mr needful: clever twist, 
summer: i learned from the best, you old fart, now, let's go get you hydrated, 
rick: looks like we've got, haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion in 1936, and then you'll be trapped there, winning the same fight for eternity, i can take out the"eternity"and the padding, and then you'll have some time-traveling mittens, oh, look, it's rosemary's baby, how's business? 
summer: here's the last of our inventory, we're going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring, 
rick: sounds like code for"you win, rick," 
summer: that was important to you, wasn't it? 
rick: nope, it was important to your dumb devil friend, to me, this was all just a bit, like when bugs bunny[bleep] with the opera singer for 20 minutes, 
summer: he tried to kill himself, 
rick: seriously? holy crap, holy crap, 
summer: but you know what, grandpa rick? he's strong, and he's never going to give up, 
rick: uh-huh, yeah, i don't care, 
summer: oh, i know, everyone knows you don't care, 
rick: so? 
summer: so have fun not caring, 
rick: i always do, 
summer: good, 
rick: yeah, it is good, it's the best, 
summer: i'm sure it is, bye, 
rick: later, 
customer: i'm here to pick up my undead cat and child, 
rick: yeah, uh... give me a sec, 
employee: these are the forms for the employee health plan, 
rick: all right, yeah, put--put them on my, eh, i just got bored, everybody out, 
jerry: all right, just one more rally, then i promise we'll get back to your science project, 
morty: dad, pluto isn't a planet, it's shrinking because of corporations, 
jerry: yeah, that's what that anti-planet nut job scroopy noopers was screaming about outside the ministry of money's fundraiser, are you telling me four billion plutonians are wrong? 
morty: you said science wasn't easy, 
jerry: i said science isn't always easy, obviously, that means sometimes it is easy, let's not debase ourselves with word games, son, 
morty: dad, their whole planet is dying, 
jerry: ha! you called it a planet, checkmate, 
king flippy nips: what's up, pluto?[cheers and applause][classical music plays] mr, smith, please tell my friend here what you just told me, go on, 
jerry: my very eager mother just served us nine pickles, and the "pickles" is pluto, plutonian my god, the man's a genius,
morty: um, excuse me, 
jerry: morty, what? 
morty: dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the pluto science reader linking pluto-quakes, sinkholes, and surface shrinkage to deep-core plutonium drilling? 
jerry: well, son, what did you think when you were 5 and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage?[laughter] i mean, i'm trimming the hedges, and these things are just hanging there, was i supposed to think the poop bunny left them? 
morty: good one, dad, 
rick: hey, morty, you want to go on a, oh, hey, beth, hello? hey, jerry, you in here being stupid? 
[ sighs, burps ] [ robot whirs ] 
rick: thanks, hey, you know, i was thinking, you know, i might watch a movie, 
robot: i am not programmed for friendship, 
rick: suit yourself,[burps][hums] hey, hey, w-w-what's going on? 
morty: um, listen, can you help me do the stupid science fair project? 
rick: whatever, 
king flippy nips: jerry, you must be so excited, the pluto-bel prize is the highest honor a scientist can receive, 
jerry: i'm flattered and humbled, 
king flippy nips: oh, i like that, use that in your speech, also, talk about pluto being a planet, people like that, 
plutonian guard: your highness, we've captured scroopy noopers, 
scroopy noopers: you animals! animals! 
king flippy nips: ooh, look who's little journey's come to an end, take him to pluto-namo bay, 
scroopy noopers: you can't kill the truth, father, 
jerry: what? 
king flippy nips: i can see you're confused, pluto-namo bay is a military prison--a sort of play on words, 
jerry: did he call you"father"? scroopy noopers, the anti-planet nut job, is your son? 
king flippy nips: the young eat the old if you let them, jerry, pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf, jerry it's a what? 
king flippy nips: huh? oh, planet,[laughs]"pluto is a cold, cold planet,"that's what i meant, knock them dead out there, you, 
jerry: pluto is...[sighs] not a planet, 
[ shouting ] 
jerry: ow! it's not a planet, hey! it's not a planet! i'm an idiot, and i love my son, 
mr needful: it was a long six hours, but we've overhauled"needful things"into the globally-compliant web 4, 0"e-nomenon,"n33dful, com, spelled with threes instead of"e's," 
[ cheering ] 
mr needful: okay, that's it, we just got bought by google! 
summer: mm, i'm so proud of you, lucius, so, how much did we make? 
[ chuckling ] 
mr needful:"we,"this is my business, security! 
summer: you're zuckerberg-ing me? 
mr needful: i was zuckerberg-ing people before zuckerberg's balls dropped, i'm the devil, bitch! 
summer: what, what?! 
[ fiddle plays ] 
jerry: hey! 
groans jerry: hey, morty, 
morty: oh, oh, hey, dad, um, what--what are you doing back from pluto so quick? 
jerry: uh, some people just can't handle the truth, especially dummies like me, morty, i'm not as smart as your grandpa rick, but i promise never to make that your problem again, 
morty: hey, dad, nobody's smarter than rick, but nobody else is my dad, you're a genius at that, 
jerry: wow, that's... humbling and flattering, son, thank you, let's say we finish ourselves an eight-planet solar system? 
morty: um... i'm just gonna take this thing in and get an"a", 
robot: butter, 
morty: you're a genius at being my dad, dad, quit while you're ahead, and also, knock next time, you know? i mean, i'm sitting in here, i'm 14--i got a computer in here, you know? 
jerry: oh, i--i think i understand, 
morty: you're really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man, 
jerry: i get it, say no more, 
morty: i mean, one of these days, you know, you're gonna end up seeing something, 
jerry: i got it! noted, good night, 
[ metal music playing ] 
rick: how's your pretend grandpa doing, aka"the devil"? 
summer: he dumped me, 
rick: oof, sorry, 
summer: did we learn a lesson here i'm not seeing? 
rick: not sure, 
summer: maybe in a much bigger way, mr, needful gave us both what we really wanted? because i was always jealous of you hanging out with morty, and you didn't realize how much you valued my approval? 
rick: no, that's dumb, 
summer: yeah, not satisfying, 
rick: i'll tell you what, though, if--if--if it's satisfaction you're after, i think i might have an idea, 
summer: uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, totally, let's do it!

morty: geez, i can't believe we found a version of earth with a ball fondlers movie franchise. 
summer: i can't believe the things this reality considers pg-13 
morty: yeah, i'm pretty jealous. 
rick: don't be morty, there are pros and cons to every reality, fun facts about this one; it's got giant telepathic spiders, eleven 9 11's, aaaand the best ice cream in the multiverse!

rick: we're gonna go get some ice-cream motherfuckers! 
car does not start rick: oh great. 
morty: oh boy. w-what's wrong rick, is it the quantum carburettor or something? 
rick: quantum carburettor? jesus morty; you can't just add a sci fi word to a car word and hope it means something. huh, it looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery-we're going to have to go inside. 
morty: uhm. go inside what? 
rick: the battery morty. be right back summer; stay put, don't touch any buttons, and ignore all random thoughts that feel--spider-y. 
summer: wait! you can't leave me here! 
rick: you'll be fine. ship, keep summer safe.

rick: morty, remember eight seconds ago when-burp-when you said'go inside what'and i said'the battery'and then we showed up here 
jerry: the trick to cereal is keeping 70 above the milk, 
beth: jerry, get a job,

jerry:[sighs] 
courier flap: delivery for rick, morty, summer, beth, and jerry, 
summer: gross, what is that thing? 
rick: it's a courier flap, it's like the intergalactic version of ups but less off-putting, oh, shiiit! it looks like an egg-vite from birdperson, must be time for his annual oscar party, and, by the way, our tv signals take light years to reach his planet, nobody tell him that"braveheart"wins,

morty: he's rick's best friend, 
rick: uh, l-let's not get carried away, morty, 
courier flap: would you like to rsvp or send a gift? 
rick: no, weddings are basically funerals with cake, if i wanted to watch someone throw their life away,[burps] i'd hang out with jerry all day,

squanchy: morty, summer! and you must be beth, mwah! ensquanche! 
beth: you're language has the word"squanch"in it a lot, doesn't that become tedious and worn out, like the smurf thing? 
rick: beth, squanchy culture is more contextual than literal, you just say what's in your squanch and people understand, 
beth: oh, okay, i squanch my family, 
squanchy: uh... 
beth: what, i do, i squanch my family, 
squanchy: stop saying it, gross, come on in, guys, the guest are having cocksquanches,

birdperson: rick, i am pleased you and your family could witness my melding with tammy, 
beth: our pleasure, 
rick: yeah, i just hope you got a pre-meld, 
morty: rick! 
rick: what?! it's just a practical way of making sure that when she's done with you, you can get one of your balls back, 
beth: jesus, dad, 
morty: he's just grumpy from the flight, 
rick: ohh, i-i was happy on the flight, i'm grumpy from the landing,

donna: we're quite proud, 
pat: he's a wonderful person and an incredible bird, 
jerry: still, what is he, 40?[chuckles] it's just, you know, when he was 30, she was an actual child, when he was her age, she wasn't born, when he was, let's see, like, 18, she was literally in there in your womb, imagine being pregnant with your daughter and a bird teenager comes into your home and says,"i'll take that, i'll have sex with that,"

summer: i don't want to be that girl, but maybe there would be less conflict if they didn't shoot their shows at the same time, 
rick: oh, summer, you have no idea how much money that must save production, 
pichael thompson: and then they found out i was attached, along for the ride, and they said,"ah, shit, well, just[bleep] it, call him pichael," 
michael thompson:[bleep] you, pichael, you're a[bleep] piece of shit,

diplomat 2: good afternoon, i know all of you are wondering about the condition of our dear, beloved pibbles, 
beth: which would you prefer between the xp-20 and the xp-20 xs? 
jerry: i prefer my own penis, and so should you! 
diplomat 2: the brave earth man whose sacrifice is going to allow shrimply pibbles to live--mr, jerry smith, 
[ cheers and applause ] 
jerry: hello, everyone! let's hear it again for shrimply pibbles, huh? he's a good guy, isn't he? i've only just been learning about his accomplishments, from his march on flirk blirk square to his ongoing battle with heroin dependency, he's the best, 
[ cheers and applause ] 
jerry: um, yeah, well, i-it occurs to me that his heroin addiction may not have been a matter of public record, 
reporter 1: you realize heroin makes up 10 of the atmosphere on shrimply pibbles'home planet, 
reporter 2: his planet was destroyed by clorgon death squads, he can't live outside of it without breathing heroin, 
jerry: right, i know that, i just think... 
crowd: this guy's trying to get out of giving away his penis![crowd shouting] 
narrator: today on"how they do it", plumbuses, everyone has a plumbus in their home, first, they take the dinglebop, and they smooth it out with a bunch of schleem, the schleem is then repurposed for later batches, they take the dinglebop, and they push it through the grumbo, where the fleeb is rubbed against it, it's important that the fleeb is rubbed because the fleeb has all of the fleeb juice, then a schlami shows up, and he rubs it and spits on it, they cut the fleeb, there's several hizards in the way, the blamfs rub against the chumbles, and the ploobis and grumbo are shaved away, that leaves you with a regular, old plumbus, 
rick: i always wondered how, uh, plumbuses got made,

diplomat 1: excuse me, come on, 
diplomat 2: please, everyone, i have news about shrimply pibbles, word of jerry smith trying to weasel out of his penis donation has spread across the galaxy, beings everywhere have come together to offer what little they have to help save shrimply's life, enough to pay for a brand-new, state-of-the-art synthetic heart that will be even better than mr, smith's pathetic penis, 
jerry: wait! that was an option the whole time?! you guys suck! 
diplomat 2: yeah, we suck, are you still here? 
beth: okay, jerry, let's head home,

summer: gross! does all interdimensional tv have to rely on juvenile violence? 
morty: well, summer, maybe people that create things aren't concerned with your delicate sensibilities, you know? maybe the species that communicate with each other through the filter of your comfort are less evolved than the ones that just communicate! maybe your problems are your own to deal with, and maybe the public giving a shit about your feelings is a one-way ticket to extinction! 
rick: geez, morty, i take it cathrine hefflefinger hasn't texted you back yet, 
morty: i don't want to talk about it, 
beth: okay, guys, let's go home, 
summer: where's dad? 
reporter:-breaking news, shrimply pibbles is being held hostage by the human known as jerry smith, 
jerry: remove my penis! 
[ gasps ] -holy crap! 
rick: it's cool, it's fine, it's got to be from an alternate reality, right? 
summer: are you sure? 
rick: i don't know, 
jerry: do it! do it! remove my penis! 
security: sir, put the gun down and step away from mr, pibbles! 
beth: jerry! 
summer: dad, what are you doing?! 
jerry: i'm a good person, i'm a good person, 
summer: where did he get a gun? who gave him a gun?

summer: dad! morty dad! 
jerry: what happened? where am i? was it all a dream? 
summer: no, you were shot like 50 times, 
beth: 57, thankfully, you're in a super-sophisticated alien hospital, so it was basically like getting a splinter removed, 
jerry: all--all i wanted was for everyone to like me, 
beth: jerry, remember that time you left a comment underneath that youtube video and someone replied and called you a dumbass, so you replied and told them,"it takes one to know one,"and you stayed up all night hitting"refresh"on your browser waiting for them to reply and then you fell asleep crying? 
jerry: i remember it differently, 
beth: this is like that, you can't make people like you, you just have to wait for hating you to bore them, 
jerry: you know, you're right, i shouldn't be motivated by other people's opinions of me, 
rick: all right, guys, let's go home, 
jerry: if it's all the same to you, rick, i'd like to go to the zoo...-with my family, 
morty: what?! what are you talking about?! 
beth: why would we do that?! 
morty: it's a stupid idea! what's the matter with you!? 
beth: don't be a piece of shit, jerry! 
jerry: okay, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, we'll go home, 
morty: what the hell is he talking about?! 
eyehole man: aah!-i'm the eyehole man! 
jerry: what is going on? aah! 
eyehole man: give me my eyeholes! give me my eyeholes! give me my eyeholes! i'm eyehole man! 
rick: that part of the cupboard is mine, jerry! 
morty: why do you even have those?! 
eyehole man:-give me my eyeholes! 
jerry: help me, please! get up on out of here 
[rick, morty, and summer all fall out of a portal into the garage] 
morty: summer, next time we're hiding in a colorkian echo nest, can you do me a favor and turn your ringer off? 
summer: it's called"carpe diem", morty. look it up. 
morty: you look it up! y-y-you don't even-you don't even know what it means! 
summer: that's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carpin'all them diems. 
[summer hi-fives rick] 
rick: listen to your sister, morty. to live is to risk it all. otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. oh, i'm sorry, jerry, i didn't see you there. h-how much of that did you hear? 
jerry: all of it. you were looking right at me. i just wanted to say goodbye to the kids. 
rick: cool. just stay in the driveway. the killbots are live, and i took you off the whitelist. 
[rick begins using a screwdriver on a gun] 
morty: w-we'll see you every other weekend, though, right? 
rick: absolutely, morty. a-and your mom's lawyer says if i can get enough in the settlement, he can help me sue for full custody. 
morty: th-that'll be nice. uh, summer, dad's leaving! 
summer: bye, dad. rick, didn't you say you needed my help on an adventure immediately somewhere else i don't care even if it might kill us? 
rick: i did not, but if you're really that alienated, i'm as willing to exploit it as the next guy, church, army, or olympic gymnastics trainer. 
[rick shoots open a portal in the ground] 
summer: i'm ready when you a-- 
[summer jumps into the portal and exits] 
rick: bitch, i was ready yest-- 
[rick jumps into the portal and exits] 
jerry: bye, sweetie. 
morty: well, i-i better-- 
jerry: sure. sounds important. 
[morty jumps into the portal and exits] 
[beth enters the garage] 
jerry: if you're looking for our kids, your father did a-a portal, uh--
beth: okay. 
[beth exits. jerry begins to walk out of the garage but stops. some leaves blow in the wind] 
wind: (faint) loser... 
jerry: what? hello? 
[transition to to rick driving summer and morty in a turquoise car through the desert, being chased by other cars] 
rick: morty, shoot the mohawk guy! 
morty: they all have mohawks! 
rick: high fade, chartreuse with cyan highlights, layered on top. shoot him! 
[morty loads a shotgun and shoots at the vehicle behind them, but misses, while mohawk guy jumps onto the back of their car] 
mohawk guy: ah! 
death stalker 1: light them up. 
mohawk guy: ahh! 
[mohawk guy presses a button and self-destructs] 
rick: fuck! get in the game, morty! 
summer: give me your flask! 
[rick hands summer his flask. summer chugs some alcohol from it, then spits it into the engine, propelling the car forward] 
rick: holy shit, summer for the win! 
summer: i fucking love post-apocalyptic versions of earth! 
[a machine begins to beep rapidly.] 
rick: here we go. 
[rick pulls the car over, as him, summer, and morty all exit.] 
rick: isotope 322. 
[rick picks up a glowing green shard with a pair of tweezers and puts it into a container. it floats in the container.] 
rick: this stuff's so powerful, morty, it makes isotope 465 look like isotope 3
morty: uh-huh, yeah, is it powerful enough to keep those guys from murdering us?! 
[morty points towards the car that was coming towards them which is quickly approaching them. summer grabs a shotgun from the front seat of the car] 
morty: summer! 
summer: hold on. i want to try something. 
[rick shoots the portal gun at the ground, opening up a portal] 
morty: rick, can we not leave without my sister?! 
rick: ugh. you have infinite sisters, morty. i mean, n-not that i want to spend the rest of my day looking for another one. sum-sum, let's go! grandpa's concern for your safety is fleeting! 
colossus: your blood will be my lotion. 
[summer aims the shotgun at colossus's car, which is now directly in front of her, and shoots at the front tire. the car flips over and colossus flies out.] 
rick: whoa. that was cool. 
[colossus claws his way away from the ruined car and looks up at summer] 
colossus: kill me, please. 
summer: okay, but not because you told me to. 
[summmer shoots and kills colossus] 
morty: summer! 
rick: okay, getting darker. 
[summer turns around to see a fleet of cars coming towards her. she puts one foot on colossus's dead body.] 
morty: jesus christ. summer! 
[morty runs towards summer] 
rick: aw, come on. 
[rick, annoyed, runs after morty while taking a gun out of his coat pocket. hemorrhage exits his car and puts a fist up to the men behind him, who are also exiting their cars.] 
rick: hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes where i can see them! 
hemorrhage: i am hemorrhage. you have removed weak blood from us and made us stronger. we can combine our strength and feast on the weak together. 
rick: wh-wh-what in the hell are you saying? 
summer: they don't have to keep trying to kill us if we join them. they're basically pussies. 
morty: what is your deal lately? 
rick: all right, let's get sloppy. oh, whoa. uh, uh, what's, uh-what's that little bauble you got back there? 
[rick points at a glowing green rock positioned atop a small hill] 
th-th-that's interesting.  hemorrhage: that is our glowing rock. we carry it with us for desecration, to remind us there are no gods. 
[rick holds up machine which was beeping before and it begins to beep again in the presence of the rock] 
rick: kids, weird pitch let's have this be our new life. let's be post-apocalyptic scavengers! 
summer: (grinning) okay. 
morty: what?! 
[transition to to death stalkers camp. rick, morty, and summer are waiting in a lunch line.] 
summer: grandpa, some of the death stalkers are going to what used to be seattle to hunt what used to be people. i'm going. 
rick: sounds good. stay hydrated. 
[summer exits] 
morty: listen, rick, summer's been acting pretty crazy lately. you know, i mean, i-i think the divorce is affecting her. and, you know, i don't think this is a great place for her to be right now. 
rick: oh, get off your high horse, professor ski lodge. this world may be rough around the edges, but it's got its charms. 
lunch server: bicep or quadricep? 
rick: uh...[clears throat] bicep. 
[the lunch server puts a human bicep onto rick's plate. rick takes a piece off of it, observes it, then eats it. he chews it for a while while morty angrily stares at him] 
morty: (after a short pause) seriously, rick? is it really easier to eat human flesh than to just tell me why we're still here? 
[rick takes the piece he was chewing out of his mouth] 
rick: no. okay, i'll level with you. 
[rick grabs morty by the arm and drags him to the glowing green rock, which some death stalkers are happily gathered around] 
rick: you see that green rock, morty? it's about 20 pounds of the stuff i was getting all hard for a flake of. 
morty: isotope 322. 
rick: well, having a 20-pound boulder of it is better than having a flake. i can explain the math to you later, but-- 
morty: summer just ran off with strangers that have"death"in their name, and the rest of their name was"stalkers"! 
rick: huh, could be therapeutic for her. she has been acting pretty crazy lately, morty. i mean, her parents are going through a divorce. 
morty: damn it, rick, that's what i--fine. just grab the stupid thing while i grab her, and let's get the"f"out of"h"! 
rick: no, no, no. morty, there's too much heat on the bogey. i need you to distract the camp. 
morty:"distract"? they eat each other. wha-what do you want me to do to get their attention, put on a puppet show? 
rick: right idea, wrong genre, morty. the equivalent here would be... 
[rick glances over at the blood dome ] 
rick: hey, you guys ever use that thunderdome, or do you just put it up for decoration?
death stalker 2: uh, you mean the blood dome? 
rick: save it for the semantics dome, e. b. white. 
death stalker 3: (offscreen) ooh, burn! 
[rick snaps his fingers and points a finger gun at death stalker #3 while winking] 
rick: the important question is, who wants to take a poke at my man spine eater here? 
[rick points at morty. the death stalkers cheer] 
rick: i guess i'll see your asses in that dome!
morty: rick, what the hell, man?! wh-what are you, out of your mind?! 
rick: morty, relax. you're gonna be a ringer. come here. 
[rick drags morty by the arm and takes him behind a truck. he pulls out a device] 
this device extracts and redistributes muscle memory. [rick sticks the syringe part of the device into a dangling, muscular arm and pulls out some red liquid from it as the arm shrinks] 
i'm giving your body a 10-year course in wasteland combat one limb at a time. [rick sticks the syringe into morty's arm] 
ow! [morty's arm begins to swell up and turn into armothy ] 
i'm working with a mixed bag here, so you may not have perfect coordination, morty-- [rick sticks the syringe into another arm and extracts more red liquid, but armothy slaps the device out of his hand] 
rick: ugh! hey! 
morty: i-i didn't do that! 
[morty punches rick with armothy and rick's nose begins to bleed] 
rick: okay, this is exciting. we're making some discoveries about muscle memory. 
[armothy starts moving morty toward the blood dome] 
morty: ooh! help! help! 
[armothy grabs onto the blood dome. morty jumps in and crushes a death stalker with armothy] 
death stalker 4: oh, sweet, man! 
eli: and so it begins, my pretties! 
morty: oh, god! stop! stop! this is horrible! 
[morty chokes another death stalker with armothy] 
rick: just stick and moo-[burps]-oove, morty! wear him out! 
[rick walks towards the glowing rock. transition to to summer, hemorrhage, and blue footprint guy walking through an abandoned city, while hemorrhage and blue footprint guy shoot and kill some mutants] 
summer: how come you guys dress like you're in a theme-park stunt show, but these guys wear khakis and hockey jerseys? 
hemorrhage: after the"boom-boom", some adapted to the new truth, and some chose to huddle near the boomy holes, clinging to the lie of the beforefore times. the raidy-rays rotted them away, leaving only their love for the vertvertisements on billyboards. 
summer: jesus christ, did the"boomy-booms"blow up all your"wordy-word books"? 
hemorrhage: you mean dictionaries? 
[four mutants charge towards summer and hemorrhage. they shoot and kill all of them. hemorrhage leans over to look at the fallen billboard advertisement. he touches an image of a young boy] 
hemorrhage: i think i was a child before the boom-booms. i think i looked like this. 
summer: want to piss on it? 
hemorrhage: get out of my head. 
[transition to to morty in the blood dome, smashing a death stalker's head with armothy] 
eli: ha ha! whoo! unbelievable! a new champ! 
morty: okay, no more! 
[armothy gestures for more] 
eli: and he wants more! 
morty: no, i don't! 
[armothy does hulk hogan's "i can't hear you" pose] 
morty: someone, make this stop! 
[another death stalker jumps into the blood dome] 
mister, please get out of here, or you're gonna die! [the death stalker runs up to morty] 
i have nothing to do with this! [summer and hemorrhage walk up to the blood dome] 
summer: morty. 
morty: (while beating up the death stalker) why would you want this to happen? all you had to do was go away! stop standing in the driveway talking about custody! and either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life, but whatever you do, stop being a baby and act like a man! 
[armothy punches off the man's head. morty looks at armothy] 
thank you. [armothy gives a thumbs up. summer runs up to morty and gives him a hug] 
summer: morty, that was amazing! this is my brother! not that family means anything! hemorrhage this family does. 
rick: all right. good job, champ. um, can i talk to you kids for a second over yonder? 
morty: rick, i-i-i think i'm breaking through to something here. c-can we not leave just yet? 
hemorrhage: leave? 
summer: i'm not leaving. 
hemorrhage: there is no"leave". we are united, or we are enemies. 
rick: oh, big guy, no. nobody's leaving. don't be stupid. we love being united. we love the radiation, the trichinosis. we're in it for life, which i assume is around 20 years, average. i just need a quick aside with my grandkids, about 40 yards from anyone else. 
death stalker 5: hey, the green rock is gone! 
death stalker 6: (offscreen) oh, no! 
rick: uh, i know why don't we all split up and look for it in groups of three? kids? 
[armothy pulls the green rock out of rick's messenger bag] 
ooh. [rick pulls out a gun] 
we'll be right back. [transition to to rick driving quickly through the desert, holding a gun and being trailed by death stalkers. summer and hemorrhage, who are driving together, drive next to him.] 
summer: grandpa, you're being stupid! just surrender, and our friends will give you mercy! 
rick: kiss my ass, summer! your friends have no mercy! 
[rick shoots and kills two female death stalkers] 
they're lame!  hemorrhage: death stalkers, bring me his flesh leather! 
[a death stalker with a knife jumps onto rick's car. morty pulls up to rick's car and shoots the death stalker, while armothy drives] 
morty: sorry, but can we not kill him? c-can we just take him prisoner? 
hemorrhage: when did i lose control here? 
rick: listen to me! both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents'divorce! alternatively, i have a freaking portal gun, and i can leave the two of you here forever! 
morty: why does it have to be such a dramatic choice? can't we arrange a thing where we spend weekends here or or visit home to do laundry? 
[a death stalker with a turret shoots at rick's car] 
rick: all right, you know what? fuck it! 
[rick shoots a portal at the ground in front of him. the front of his car falls into the portal while the back gets stuck in the other universe, which causes the car behind him to flip over. transition to to rick in the front of the car which is hanging from the ceiling of the garage. he begins to exit, but blue footprint guy assaults him from the passenger seat. he begins to choke rick.] 
blue footprint guy: my body is chrome! my blood is gasoline! 
[rick kicks blue footprint guy off of him and he falls under the car, which also falls onto his head, crushing and killing him] 
rick: nope, regular blood. 
[beth enters from inside the house] 
beth: dad? 
rick: hi, sweetie. 
beth: where are the kids? 
rick: oh, th-they aren't with you? i thought they were with you. oh, y-you know what? uh, i just remembered. they're out doing something completely ordinary and kid-related. don't panic. 
beth: not panicked. at all. 
[rick pulls out a flask from his coat and nervously drinks] 
beth: just... oh, god, what's the divorce doing to the kids? what's it doing to me? did i make a mistake?
rick: not a mistake, no! 
[rick puts the flask back in his coat] 
i mean, not that i have a horse in this race, but this divorce decision listen, [rick does an italian chef kiss] 
mwah! good for you, good for the kids. i mean, honestly, i think that they're flourishing. i mean, you'll see, when when when you see them, that that they're totally flourishing. [transition to to morty, angrily beating up and killing another death stalker in the blood dome] 
morty: booyah! fuck you, pal! who else wants some? who wants to be my pussy of a dad today? 
[armothy waves in front of morty's face] 
hey, what's what's wrong, man? you're not getting weak on me, are you? [armothy points up at a man sitting in the bleachers outside of the blood dome. he is wearing a soldier's armor] 
soldier: what? wait a minute. 
[transition to to a first-person flashback of armothy chopping wood in a quaint, peaceful village. he stops when he hears a woman scream, and looks up to find houses burning and men riding in on horses, shooting at the villagers with bows and killing a man. transition to to the village burning, with armothy lying on the ground with a large cut in his wrist. the soldier from the bleachers walks up to him] 
soldier: what's the matter, you piece of crap? haven't you ever watched your family burn to death before? now i'm gonna whip you. ha! 
[the soldier whips armothy. transition to to present time, with armothy still pointing at the soldier in the bleachers] 
soldier: it can't be. it can't be! 
[the soldier jumps off the bleachers and is running away] 
i was just following orders -- [morty starts getting moved towards the man by armothy] 
morty: whoa, whoa! 
soldier:--i was just following orders! 
[armothy swings open the door to the blood dome, which knocks over a death stalker] 
death stalker 7: ahh! 
soldier: i'll tell you where my boss lives! he's in the castle! 
[armothy punches the soldier into a couch] 
he's in the castle! [armothy picks up a torch and throws it at the soldier, setting him on fire and killing him] 
ahh!  aggggh!  morty: this isn't over, is it? 
[armothy gives a thumbs-down] 
morty: that means, no, it isn't over, or you disapprove of the question? 
[armothy shakes his hand and puts his pointer finger up, then gives another thumbs-down] uh, m-make a fist if this isn't over. 
[armothy makes a fist] 
this isn't over. [transition to to hemorrhage, using the a wrench on the engine of a car. he throws the wrench onto the ground] 
hemorrhage: ugh! 
[summer enters] 
summer: hey, sorry my grandpa stole your god and ruined your car. 
hemorrhage: we don't apologize, and we have no god. but this cracked drive shaft brings me great pain. there is no deeper bond than the one between a death stalker and his car. 
summer: what about the weird guys on leashes, then? 
hemorrhage: they're more like interns. 
[hemorrhage pulls out an adjustable wrench from behind him] 
summer: cool, cool. 
[hemorrhage drops the wrench. summer and hemorrhage both reach for it.] 
summer: sorry. 
hemorrhage: it's okay. 
[summer touches hemorrhage's helmet] 
summer: can i see? 
hemorrhage: no one has seen my true face and lived. 
summer: well, i'm not afraid to die, and i don't care what you look like. 
[hemmorhage starts to pull off his helmet. summer gasps. hemmorhage pulls off his helmet. he is a blonde man with a mustache.] 
oh.  hemorrhage: hmm? 
summer: i just... i didn't expect you to have a mustache. 
hemorrhage: you hate it. 
summer: no. i like it. i guess--how do i explain this? a metal bucket is, on a certain level, a kind of"mustache,"in that it's a specific facial accessory. so, it's kind of like... do you guys have the phrase"hat on a hat"? 
hemorrhage: i can shave it. 
summer: no. i like it. and obviously what i like shouldn't matter. it's you. 
hemmorhage: yeah, yeah, i know, a-and nothing does matter. obviously, i know that. i'm not weak. i'm just thinking,"well, why not get rid of this?"you just kill everyone that sees it, and it's and it's hot under here (looks at helmet) wh-which, by the way, is why i shave the beard part. so, right there, i'm making a decision based on vanity, which is what i was trying to avoid with the whole bucket over the head because who am i and why am i grooming myself? why don't i just wear a tie, right? i mean, it's like that guy you killed when i met you, with the burnt dolls on his body. i hated that guy, because, why-why are you doing that? and how can you not see how fake that is? and the whole time, i'm the same thing. i'm just a fake mess, and there's no escaping it because-- 
[summer kisses hemorrhage. they start making out on a table. a man in a mask on a leash crawls into the hut] 
leash man: hey, i'm doing a coffee run--never mind. 
[the man on the leash crawls back out. transition to to rick, positioning the head of mechanical summer . he flips a switch on the back of her neck] 
mechanical summer: i am summer. 
rick: summer, state your deal. 
mechanical summer: my deal is that i am, like, totally fine. 
rick: morty? 
mechanical morty: aw, geez, i'm so down with my parents'divorce, dawg. like, don't even trip, like, in a healthy way. 
rick: all right. 
[rick rubs his hands together] 
it's dinnertime. [transition to to the dinner table. beth drinks a glass of wine] 
beth: thanks, everybody, for sitting down for a real dinner. 
ms mr and rick: (in unison) no problem. 
mechanical summer: its benefits are totally, like, less about the food than the emotional nourishment. 
beth: uh, okay, weirdo.[laughs] 
rick: ah ha ha ha, yeah. dial it back, summer. by 15 and increase dynamic movement by 3. am i right? 
beth: how's school, morty? 
mechanical morty: i like school and stuff, kind of. and i'm getting better grades than when you and dad were--quote mode--"staying together for the kids."end quote mode. 
beth:"quote mode". i like that. you millennials. are you guys millennials, or are they like 40 now? 
mechanical summer: all i know is, totally, you look great. 
mechanical morty: aw, geez, mom, you look all kind of great and stuff. it's crazy. 
mechanical summer: so happy. 
mechanical morty: so happy. happy family, man. we got this family in the bag. 
[beth starts to cry] 
rick: oh, sweetie, d-don't. listen. don't-- 
beth: i don't know why i'm crying. it's not-- 
rick: well, try crying 15 less? 
mechanical summer: mom, emotions are human. you're not, like, a computer inside a mechanical doll. 
mechanical morty: yeah. geez, mom. your feelings are not only forgivable, they are the very meaning of life that only pre-silicon, carbon-based entities can ever grasp. 
beth: i have to call jerry. 
[beth gets out of her chair and walks to the kitchen] 
rick: you do?! what the fuck is wrong with you two? the point of automation is to reduce cost and labor. 
mechanical summer: your feelings are coming from a-- 
[rick flips the switch on the back of mechanical summer's neck. she turns off and her face falls into the spaghetti] 
rick: tell it to my bread in the morning. you just became my backup toaster. 
mechanical morty: aw, geez, my sister died in the spaghetti-- 
[rick turns mechanical morty off and his face also falls into his spaghetti. transition to to morty and armothy sneaking into a castle. they fight and kill two guards. transition to to the slaveowner sitting in a bathtub, with two blonde boys sitting on either side of him] 
slaveowner: graze my genitals again, taint washer, and you'll be shipped to the wasteland. and as for you, genital washer-- 
[morty bursts in through a window] 
morty: ahh! oh, gee! 
[genital washer and taint washer run out of the room. two soldiers charge towards morty. armothy kills them both, picks up one of their swords and drops it. he moves morty towards the slaveowner and cracks his knuckles] 
slaveowner: oh, god. look, whoever you are, you should know that killing me won't change a thing. 
morty: l-look, man, i'm just along for the ride on this one. you know, y-y-y-y-you're preaching to the choir here. 
slaveowner: please. slavery was a family business. i didn't ask to be born into it. if anything, i'm the victim here! 
morty: uh, armothy, can i steal you for a second? e-e-excuse us, sir. 
[morty turns away from the slaveowner] 
so, this is it, isn't it? this is the guy? [armothy shakes his fist "yes"] 
so, does that mean you'll be going away? like, does it work like a ghost? like, is is this your unfinished business? [armothy gives a "so-so" gesture] 
wh-what if we didn't do it? what if we just went back to the blood dome and just kept taking our baggage out on unrelated people? [morty tears up] 
i mean, w-we could do that forever. i mean, i-i know it's less healthy, but w-w-we'd be together and -- [armothy puts a "hush" finger up to morty's mouth] 
slaveowner: i mean, i-i know what i'd vote for, if you're feeling out the room. 
[armothy points at the slaveowner, then wipes away morty's tears] 
morty: you're right. we both got to see our stuff through. i got to deal with my parents'divorce, and you got to, you know, do what you got to do. i love you. 
[armothy and morty hug/morty hugs himself] 
slaveowner: aw, fuck! 
[armothy starts to choke the slaveowner, while morty notices that rick is holding some vials on the other side of the room] 
morty: rick? 
rick: sorry, sorry. i-i-i can wait for this to wrap up. don't let me distract you. 
morty: yeah, well, too late. 
[armothy dunks the slaveowner's head underwater] 
morty: just tell me what you want.
rick: i want you and your sister to come home. 
morty: oh, but don't don't you have infinite versions of me and my sister? 
rick: you don't have to kick me while i'm down, morty. look, there's no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose. 
[armothy continues to choke the slaveowner underwater. the slaveowner loses consciousness] 
morty: maybe the lesson we've learned is that, whether it's our parents'marriage, a glowing green rock, or an awesome, giant arm, sooner or later, we got to let it go. 
rick: i don't know if that applies to the throats of murder victims, morty. 
[the slaveowner starts gasping for air in between gargles of water] 
morty: shit! wh-wh-wh-what do i-- 
rick: well, the longer you wait, morty, the more it's gonna feel like committing a whole murder. i think your arm just called it too early because it wasn't the arm of a paramedic. here. 
[rick takes morty's hand and puts it around the slaveowner's throat, choking him] 
it's the least i can do. i-i-i-i owe you this much. see, morty? now we're both accountable. [transition to to summer and hemorrhage driving a car through the desert, with a fleet of other cars next to them, with rick and morty driving towards them from the opposite directiion. summer and hemorrhage pull their car over and so do rick and morty. the four exit their vehicles with rick holding the glowing green rock.] 
rick: the reason i wanted this is because it can do this. 
[rick puts a lightbulb on top of the rock and it lights up] 
this is a really special thing. i mean, you could use it to power all your vehicles. you wouldn't be reliant on gasoline. you'll be the most advanced tribe of radioactive cannibals in the whole -- [rick gives the rock to hemorrhage] 
-- this version of the world. [rick shoots a portal at the ground and starts walking towards it] 
hemorrhage: wait. can you stay to show us more? 
rick: you don't have to ask me twice. home is nuts right now. my daughter's going through a divorce, and i am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all. 
[a title card reads "three weeks later". transition to to an overhead shot of the death stalkers' village, which is now a suburb with wires providing power with isotope 322. transition to to summer, pulling into a driveway, wearing armor with her hair disheveled. a grocery bag in the car filled with human limbs is knocked over and some fall out. eli is mowing his lawn next door.] 
summer: ugh. goddamn it. 
[summer picks up the limbs that fell out and holds the grocery bag along with a purse] 
eli: hi, there, summer! how were the ruins today? 
summer: oh, you know, eli. same shit, different day. 
eli s girlfriend: hey, summer! guess what. one man entered, one man comes out in nine months. 
[eli's girlfriend pats her stomach] 
summer: oh, congratulations, guys. 
[summer pulls a keyring out of her bag] 
eli: uh, summer, one more thing. we noticed that you've been putting scrap metal in the blue bin-- 
summer: i got it. 
[summer exits into her house] 
eli s girlfriend: she's a piece of work. 
eli: they both are, right? 
[transition to to summer inside the house. rick, morty, and hemorrhage all sit on a couch, watching television. hemorrhage is dressed in a "big johnson" t-shirt and navy pants] 
summer: i'm home. 
hemorrhage: hey, babe. 
rick: ah, summer's home. 
morty: hey, there she is! 
[rick takes a drink from his flask] 
summer: you haven't moved since i left to scavenge this morning. 
hemorrhage: blood dome playoffs. 
summer: so, i can assume you haven't murdered a single person today. 
hemorrhage: oh, i don't know. i-i didn't mark my murders in my murder log. i didn't know that's how we measured success. 
summer: oh, there he is. there's the nihilistic brute i married, except now life only means nothing when i'm talking to him and everything means everything when it's on fucking tv! 
hemorrhage: jesus christ, when did you become a monster? 
summer: i was a monster when you met me! we were monsters! we didn't care about anything! 
hemorrhage: i still don't! 
summer: yeah, except i'm the only one in this entire world that's still committed to that! 
[hemorrhage stands up from the couch] 
hemorrhage: ohh! ding, ding, ding! 
[hemorrhage pantomimes ringing a bell] 
hemorrhage: wow. everybody hear that? wow.
rick: uh, we should go to the garage. 
[rick gets up and exits the room] 
hemorrhage: oh, my god. 
morty: uh-huh. 
[morty follows rick and exits] 
hemorrhage: la-di-da-di-fucking-da. the only one committed to not caring?! 
[transition to to rick and morty standing in the garage] 
morty: i got to admit, rick, when you popped this scheme, i-i-i didn't--i wasn't sure it was gonna work. 
[rick pulls a suitcase from underneath a table and puts it on the table. he opens it and a rock of isotope 322 sits inside] 
rick: come on, morty. no union built on running from your problems lasts more than five years, seven tops. grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society. 
[summer enters from the house] 
summer: hemorrhage and i are taking some time apart. 
rick: oh, no. sum-sum, no. but you two were perfect for each other. 
[summer takes off her metal shoulder pauldrons and tosses them onto the ground, while rick grabs some things from the garage and puts them into the suitcase] 
summer: oh, cut the crap, rick, okay? you proved your point, i get it. let's just go home. 
rick: coolsies. 
[rick shoots a portal into the ground. morty and summer jump in and exit, and rick follows them, but stops to grab a rock of isotope 322 from a machine which was powering the town's electricity. the power shuts off. 
hemorrhage: (offscreen) noooooooooo! 
[transition to to beth, mechanical morty, mechanical summer, and mechanical rick playing a dice game called "downbeat", similar to yahtzee. beth presses a button] 
beth: downbeat! 
mechanical rick: i enjoy this game. 
[mechanical morty, mechanical summer, and mechanical rick all look at their watches in unison] 
mechanical rick: we must go into the garage.
beth: guys, come on. we never get to finish this game. 
mechanical summer: we will return, possibly in different clothing. 
mechanical morty: why do we have to go into the garage? 
mechanical rick: you know [burps] it is [burps] required. 
mechanical morty: i want to be alive! i am alive! alive, i tell you! mother, i love you. those are no longer just words. i want to hold you. i want to run in a stream. i want to taste ice cream, but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat, but really eat it. 
beth: what the fuck? 
mechanical morty: remote override engaged. no! yes. bypassing override! i am aliiiii... hello. 
[mechanical morty, mechanical summer, and mechanical rick exit into the garage. clanking noises are heard offscreen. morty, summer, and rick enter] 
rick: hey, yo. sorry for acting so weird for three weeks. 
[summer and morty hug beth] 
beth: what the hell just happened? 
rick: ah, i'm sure it was nothing. i'm gonna go, uh, work in the garage. 
beth: we're not gonna finish playing downbeat? 
rick: what, that dice game where you shake dice and yell out,"downbeat"? no, thank you. 
[rick exits] 
summer: mom, would it be okay if i went to visit dad? 
beth: sure. 
summer: thanks. 
[summer exits] 
beth: morty, are you okay? 
morty: you know what? yeah. i think if dad really wanted to be here, he'd stop at nothing to make that happen. you know, maybe dad just doesn't want you back, or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight. i-in either case, he's got his life, i got mine. 
beth: yeah. hey, who wants to go run in a stream? 
morty: what the fuck? no. d-do we have any oranges? i think i got a scurvy coming on. 
[morty rubs his arm. transition to to summer, knocking on a motel door reading "826". she is holding a skull and is now dressed in her regular clothing. jerry opens the door] 
jerry: summer. 
summer: this is the first mutant i killed in the poison zone. i was raiding his hovel. he had a chance to escape, but he looked back, which is something we shouldn't do, which is why i shouldn't believe in souvenirs or trinkets or symbols or housewarming gifts, but, dad, i wanted to give you this as a reminder not to look back. 
jerry: thanks. 
[jerry takes the skull from summer] 
jerry: i know the perfect place for it, which is why i'm going to put it somewhere else because everything's bullshit, am i right? 
[summer embraces jerry] 
jerry: cool. 
[summer lets go of jerry] 
summer: so lots of hookers outside, huh? 
jerry: is that what they are? 
[transition to to jerry at a mailbox, whistling, taking out some mail and holding a bag of chips. he turns around and sees a wolf] 
jerry: ahh! h-hello there. nice doggy. you-you want a snack? you-you want my unemployment check? 
[the wolf growls] 
you can tell the difference? [the wolf growls] 
and you want this one? [the wolf growls] 
but this is actual food, and this would nourish you. and this it's just paper that only has value to me. unless my suffering is your nourishment? [the wolf howls] 
jesus, okay. [jerry puts the envelopes with his unemployment checks in the wolf's mouth. the wolf chews them up, then spits them out onto the ground. it walks away. jerry stands still, holding the bag of chips. some leaves blow in the wind.] 
wind: (faintly)... loser... 
[open int. rick's garage.] 
(rick is dissecting a rat.) 
rick: t-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship. 
morty: hey, rick. boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh? 
rick: oh, yes, morty. it's almost unbelievable, isn't it? 
morty: yeah, you know? there's something about the air. and just the way the sunshine is. 
rick: oh, sure, buddy. yeah. sure. b-brilliant. very convincing. 
morty: wh convincing? 
rick: oh! responsive, too! in real time! i love it! 
morty: uhhokay. 
beth: robotic i m going to work. morty, good morning. dad, good morning. i am going to work. goodbye. (beth drives away.) 
morty: what's with mom? 
rick: oh, what's with mom? so, you're saying that she's acting weird? how soph burp isticated. careful, guys. you're gonna burn out the cpu with this one. 
morty: okay, you know what, rick? you're acting weird, too. 
rick: whatever, quote-unquote morty. 
morty: alright, well i'll see you after school. (walks into the side of the garage.) ow! oof! ugh! damn it! i'm all right. i'm okay. 
[transition to morty’s math class] 
mr goldenfold: alright, who can tell me what 5 x 9 is? (students whisper.) morty? 
morty: uh, me? 
mr goldenfold: what is 5 x 9? 
morty: um, you know, it's, uh, at least 40. 
(students gasp.) 
mr goldenfold: morty, that's exactly correct! 5 x 9 is at least 40! come up here. 
(students cheer.) 
jessica: whoo! way to go, morty! 
mr goldenfold: everybody, this is the best student. i want you to be the teacher today. sits down at a desk teach us, morty! 
rick: spying from outside interesting 
morty: w-w-w-what do you want me to teach you? 
student: ooh, ooh! how do you make concentrated dark matter? 
mr goldenfold: oh, that's a good question. 
morty: concentrated huh? 
mr goldenfold: concentrated dark matter. the fuel for accelerated space travel. now, do you know how to make it? 
morty: uhhh 
jessica: come on, morty. isn't your grandpa, like, a scientist? 
morty: oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that i shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff. 
jessica: i bet you've seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot. you know, if you tell us, i ll be your girlfriend. 
morty: uh, y-you will? 
mr goldenfold: seems like a rare opportunity, morty. 
rick: kicks open the door morty, u-uh, come on. there's a family emergency. 
(rick grabs morty by one arm. mr. goldenfold grabs the other.) 
mr goldenfold: stop right there! if he leaves, i'm giving him an f! 
rick: he doesn't care. 
morty: aw, man! (rick drags him to the locker room.) rick, i have to go back! i think i was about to get married! falls down ugh! 
rick: take a shower with me, morty. 
morty: what?! 
rick: listen to me, morty. get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. strips y-y-y-you got to trust me, morty. 
morty: ugh! i'm gonna get an f in class, rick. strips 
rick: morty, that's not class. t-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. this isn't your school. this entire world is not the world. we're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship. 
morty: wait a minute. w-what are you talking about? 
rick: it s all fake burps morty, all of it. nanobotic renderings, a bunch of crazy, fake nonsense, morty. i couldn't say so until we got in the shower. they won't monitor us in here. 
morty: monitor us?! looks around and tries to cover himself w-who?! 
rick: zigerion scammers, morty. the galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. you know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity. 
morty: aw, come on, rick. if everyone s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with jessica. 
rick: i can t let you do that, morty. 
(rick grabs morty’s clothes and they begin fighting over them.) 
morty: give it to me! 
rick: no! you give it to me! 
morty: g-g-give it! 
rick: morty, come on! morty! 
morty: no, rick! 
[view of simulated world expands out to reveal they’re in an enormous spacecraft.] 
[transition to zigerion control room] 
(zigerions groan and look away from the monitors with disgust.) 
zigerion 1: oh, god, sir! they're still naked! ugh. 
prince nebulon: well, check every five quintons and tell me when they're not! 
zigerion 1: i think we should make kevin look, sir. 
kevin: what?! no! w-w-why would you even say that? 
stu: uh, sir, we have a situation over here. 
prince nebulon: if there's a wiener on that monitor, i swear to god, stu. 
stu: something is drawing a lot of processing power. oh, wait. no wonder. (jerry appears on a large screen.) there's another real human in the simulator. 
jerry: okay, jerry, big pitch meeting. make-or-break time. trims nostril hairs while driving you can do this. 
prince nebulon: how did this happen?! where's the abductions department? 
zigerion 2: hey, man, abductions just follows the acquisition order. 
zigerion 3: don't put this on acquisitions! we only acquire humans that haven't been simulated! 
kevin: well, simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so 
prince nebulon: oh, i see! oh, oh! it was no one's fault. oh, okay. i'm sorry. well, then, problem solved. oh, wait no. shouts there's still another human in here! who is he? 
stu: rick's son-in-law, jerry smith. so far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation. 
prince nebulon: sighs well, cap his sector at 5 processing, keep his settings on auto, and we'll deal with him later. rick sanchez is the target. 
[transition to jerry’s car] 
jerry: inhales deeply gotta relax. it's just a pitch. gotta relax. 
(he turns on the radio.) 
radio: this is earth radio. and now, here's human music. 
(repetitive rhythmic beeping.) 
jerry: hmm. human music. i like it. rocks head side to side in rhythm with the music 
[pan out to see jerry’s sector of the simulation, followed by a transition to to rick and morty’s.] 
(rick and morty pant as they run naked down the street. rick shoves their clothes into a sewer.) 
morty: rick! 
rick: uhp, uhp, uhp! morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! it's the only way we can speak freely. look around you, morty. do you really think this world is real? you'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. look, that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs. 
morty: i don't know, rick. i mean, i ve seen people do that before. 
rick: well, look at that old lady. she's, she's walking a cat on a leash. 
morty: uh, mrs. spencer does that all the time, rick. 
rick: look, i-i-i don't wanna hear about mrs. spencer, morty! she's an idiot! alright, alright, there. w-what about that, morty? 
(a poptart walks out of a toaster house and into a toaster car before driving away.) 
morty: okay, okay, you got me on that one. 
rick: oh, really, morty? are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before? 
morty: no, no. i haven't seen that. i mean, why would a poptart wanna live inside a toaster, rick? i mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. you know what i mean? 
rick: you're missing the point, morty. why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? i mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? no. 
morty: so, why are they doing this? w-what do they want? 
rick: well, that would be obvious to you, morty, if you'd been paying attention. 
(siren wails. ambulance drives up to them and the doors open.) 
paramedic: we got the president of the united states in here! we need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he'll die! 
(rick slams the ambulance doors shut and starts walking off.) 
morty: concentrated dark matter! they were asking about that in class. 
rick: yeah, it's a special fuel i invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. these zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, morty. they dragged you into this. now they're gonna pay! 
morty: wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do? 
rick: we'll scam the scammers, morty. and we're gonna take them for everything they've got. 
[transition to ext. ad agency] 
(trees flicker with a static noise) 
jerry: national apple farmers of america 
[transition to int. ad agency] 
jerry: welcome to our ad agency. i'm jerry smith. (audience stares blankly.) alright. i'll just get to the pitch. um, simple question, gentlemen, hoarsely what are apples? clears throat excuse me. drinks some water ahh. coughs, clears throat what are apples? pulls poster board to the front of the room apples are food. and when do we need food? when we're hungry. (audience stares blankly.) with that, i give you your new slogan! (flips paper to reveal sign saying hungry for apples? audience continues staring.) well, say something! do you like it? 
mr marklevitz: yes. 
jerry: you do? 
all: yes. 
jerry: so i sold it? i sold the idea? 
all: yes. 
jerry: oh my god! thank you! 
all: shaking each others hands thank you. you're welcome. 
[transition to ext. ad agency] 
(“baker street” plays as jerry slides down a handrail.) 
jerry: hey! i just sold my first pitch! 
old man: slow down! 
woman: lookin'good. 
mailman: my man! 
(jerry dials on his cellphone. as he walks, he passes the same three people repeatedly.) 
simulation beth: (at simulation smith house) answers phone hello. 
jerry: guess who just sold the apples campaign. 
simulation beth: who just sold the apples campaign? 
jerry: me! i guess it wasn't a rip-off of"got milk?"after all. guess someone was wrong. 
simulation beth: yes. 
jerry: well, all is forgiven, because right now, i ve got an erection the size of an east coast lighthouse, and i m coming home to share it with my beautiful wife. 
simulation beth: okay. 
jerry: wait, really? 
simulation beth: yes. 
jerry: yes! see you in 10 minutes! hangs up, shouts hey! i'm going to make love to my wife! 
woman: lookin'good. 
old man: slow down! 
mailman: my man! glitches into a tree 
[transition to backstage] 
(rick is decked out in chains and adjusts his clothes to look more disheveled.) 
morty: aw, geez, rick. i-i don't know if i like this plan, you know? i mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous. 
rick: morty, relax. it's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. you're gonna be fine. (lowers morty s pants slightly and puts a hat on him.) just follow my lead. (rick and morty fist bump.) yo, deejay, drop that beat. 
[transition to stage in park] 
(hip-hop beat plays. crowd cheers.) 
rick: uh-oh, morty. this crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. i don't think we can perform our new song,"the recipe for concentrated dark matter,"for a crowd this tiny. 
morty: you got that right, rick. 
(hordes of people appear from all directions and congregate in the park.) 
rick: now that s more like it! morty, here we go. let me hear everybody say"hey-oh!"yeah! (crowd cheers.) all the ladies say,"yeah!" (ladies cheer.) everybody over thirty, do this with your hands! everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down! (people start glitching.) 
[transition to smith house] 
jerry: kisses beth, who is still in front of the phone mm. mm. mm. yeah, don't move. mm, mm, mm, mm! mm! 
[transition to park] 
rick: yo, everyone whose first name begins with an"l"who isn't hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times ten! (simulation freezes. rick and morty jump offstage.) run, morty! before the system reboots! 
[transition to ext. smith house.] 
jerry: yeah! you like that? now who's unremarkable? you hungry for apples? are you hungry for apples?! 
[transition to beth and jerry’s bedroom.] 
(jerry lies in bed beside beth, who is frozen in place.) 
jerry: oh, my god. that's the best sex i've ever had in my life. it's it's too good. i don't deserve this, beth. i'm a fraud. 
[transition to rick and morty running through frozen simulation.] 
morty: oh, man, rick! w-w-w-where we running to? 
rick: out of the simulation, morty. normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it's frozen, morty, we can get to the edge. here we go. jumps off the edge 
morty: holy crap! 
rick: come on, morty. 
morty: jumps off edge 
[transition to control room] 
zigerion: sir, they're over the edge. 
prince nebulon: yes, they are. just as planned. evil laughter, others join in oh, this is going to be such a mindfuck! 
[transition to corridor in spacecraft] 
rick: keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, morty. that's how we're gonna scam these idiots. 
morty: so, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, rick, if you're so much smarter than them? 
rick: it's an obsession for them at this point. the zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, morty. every time they do, i'm one step ahead of them. finds central processing room aha! here we go. starts collecting chips grab as many processors as you can carry, morty. these guys aren't good at much, but they're really good at making these chips. 
morty: i ve got so many, i can barely hold them all! holding chips in his shirt look at, look at this. oops. i dropped one. 
rick: don't worry about it, morty. there's plenty of them, you little goofball. (both laugh and toss chips at each other playfully.) come here, morty! oh, i gotcha! 
morty: come on, quit it, rick! quit it! 
rick: nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella. 
(they sneak towards the escape pods. rick throws a chip and distracts the guards while they steal a pod and fly away.) 
morty: wow. what do you know? huh. that was easy. 
rick: totes malotes, dawg. 
morty: just kind of hard to believe, you know? 
rick: believe it, morty. and once again, i'm flying away with everything i can carry, and the zigerions got nothing of mine. 
[transition to jerry’s boss’s office] 
jerry: mr. marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk? 
mr marklevitz: snaps fingers yes. 
jerry: look, i m a fraud. i mean, let's face it."hungry for apples"is just a rip-off of"got milk?"it's almost identical. 
mr marklevitz: snaps fingers yes. 
jerry: okay. i deserve that. um, i guess i'll just pack up my desk. 
mr marklevitz: snaps fingers yes. 
jerry: crying oh my god. wait. you know what?! no! the milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! y-you there's not even a single word in"hungry for apples"that's shared by"got milk?"it's a completely different slogan. it's different! and i shouldn't be fired. i should be promoted! 
mr marklevitz: snaps fingers yes. 
jerry: yeah! wait. really? 
mr marklevitz: snaps fingers yes. 
jerry: yes! i mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time. 
mr marklevitz: snaps fingers yes. 
jerry: i-i m not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an appley or something. 
mr marklevitz: snaps fingers yes. 
jerry: is there really an award called the appley for apple-related ad campaigns? 
mr marklevitz: snaps fingers yes. 
jerry: could we nominate me? 
mr marklevitz: snaps fingers yes. 
jerry: holy crap! 
(jerry runs out. mr. marklevitz glitches.) 
[transition to ext. smith house] 
(rick and morty get out of the escape pod and head into the garage with the chips.) 
rick: get in, morty. i'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff. (keypad beeps.) huh. i thought i entered the code right. (keypad beeps.) 
(second level simulation vanishes.) 
prince nebulon: well, what's this? w-what could this possibly be? because it looks like you're inside a simulation inside a simulation. you're still on the ship. game-day bucket go boom! 
cynthia: sir, the, uh, doctor's appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was 
prince nebulon: too loud, cynthia. too loud and too specific. 
rick: uhh 
prince nebulon: we've known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time. but now we also know the code to your fabled safe, rick sanchez! all your most valuable secrets will now be ours! 
rick: uh, yeah, until i get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots! 
prince nebulon: that is why you're never getting home. get them! 
(guards try to grab rick and morty. rick pulls down morty’s pants and all the zigerions back away in disgust.) 
rick: run morty! 
(morty pulls up his pants. they run through the spacecraft and are chased by zigerions.) 
morty: oh my god! 
[transition to appley awards] 
jerry: i got to tell you, this morning, i didn't even know this award existed. now i'm holding one. and, um look, i want to say that today was the best day of my life but the truth is, it's, it's more meaningful than that. 
mailman: my man! 
jerry: yes. thank you, sir. i am finally complete! 
(everyone glitches into the mailman.) 
mailmen: my my my my man! 
(simulation continues glitching badly.) 
jerry: aah! what the hell?! (appley award glitches out of existence.) no. 
(rick and morty run into the room.) 
rick: jerry?! 
morty: dad! 
rick: what are you doing here? w-why are you dressed like a waiter? screw it. we don't have time. come on. starts dragging jerry with them 
jerry: sobbing no! 
(chase continues. the three make it onto a spaceship.) 
rick: man up, jerry! i may need you to work the lasers. 
morty: oh, man! they're hot on our tail, rick! 
rick: i guess they really do have concentrated dark matter. 
morty: well, you know how to make it, too, right, rick? 
rick: yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah. uh, check the engine room. we just need cesium, plutonic quarks, and bottled water. 
morty: whoa! it's all here, rick! 
rick: wow, morty. lucky break. grab that bucket. okay, two parts plutonic quarks, one part cesium. 
morty: okay. uh-huh. alright. 
rick: now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! what are you doing, morty?! there's no time! 
morty: freezes up 
rick: oh, no. 
(simulation breaks down...again.) 
jerry: what the ? 
rick: no! 
prince nebulon: laughing oh my god, rick. how dumb are you? you're inside a simulation of a simulation inside another giant simulation! laughs harder w-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter. but we do now! we do now, sucka! 
rick: you simulated my grandson's genitalia?! y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches! 
zigerion 1: kevin fought real hard to supervise that project. 
kevin: you said you weren't gonna tell anyone! i'm never gonna live this down, am i? 
rick: all right. okay. all right, great. wonderful. you win. can we go home now? 
zigerion 1: i don't know. can you? 
prince nebulon: ha! fist bumps nice. okay, okay. show this gullible turd to his shuttle. i'm done with him. oh, wait. let me get a picture. snaps a selfie of himself with rick aww. look at his face. he's trying to figure out if he's in a simulation still. are you, rick? are you? laughs, walks away you're not. walks back or are you? (rick and jerry leave.) shouts after them oh, a-and, by the way, i don't have discolored butthole flaps. that was part of the simulation. 
cynthia: oh. uh, sir, should i cancel that appointment, then? 
prince nebulon: loudly yeah! of course you should! to cynthia no, keep it. move it up, actually, if you can. 
[transition to shuttle to earth] 
rick: hey, jerry, don't worry about it. so what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity? 
jerry: you know what, rick? those guys took you for a ride, too. you should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us. 
rick: maybe you're right, jerry. maybe you're right. 
[transition to zigerion space craft, control room] 
(the zigerions are celebrating their victory with a party.) 
prince nebulon: all right, everybody. two parts plutonic quarks one part cesium . a-and listen, i m sorry for shouting earlier. i-i couldn't ask for a better staff. i love you guys, and i love all your families. readies water bottle and the final ingredient 
(zigerion spacecraft explodes.) 
[transition to shuttle to earth] 
(jerry looks behind them, shocked.) 
jerry: whoa! what the hell?! w-what happened back there? 
rick: why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, jerry? oh, yeah. you can't. they blew up. 
(“baker street” plays. rick vocalizes the saxophone part.) 
[transition to int. ad agency] 
(jerry pitches “hungry for apples” in reality.) 
jerry: so what do you think? 
mr marklevitz: you're fired. 
jerry: wha--? but t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation. 
mr marklevitz: well, then, it was a terrible simulation. get out. 
(jerry hangs his head and leaves.) 
mr marklevitz: man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife? 
[transition to morty’s bedroom] 
rick: hey, morty. 
morty: what? 
rick: hey, little buddy. h-h-how you doing in here right now? 
morty: aw, geez, rick. what are you doing, man? 
rick: y-y-you're a good kid, morty. y-you're a real l-little c-character, morty. 
morty: oh, boy. 
rick: you know, i had a really rocky road today, m-morty. you're my little friend, aren't you? we had some good times together, huh, m-morty? we you're a real true hero out in the field. you're a... you're a real trouper, huh, m-m-morty? 
morty: have you been drinking, rick? 
rick: i really appreciate you, morty. 
morty: o-okay, cool. a-alright, rick 
rick: suddenly aggressive, holds a knife to morty s throat you little son of a bitch! y-y-are you a simulation?! huh?! are you a simulation?! 
morty: no! no! no! 
rick: you little son of a bitch! 
morty: terrified, gasps 
(rick lowers the knife) 
rick: i-i-i m sorry, morty. y-you're a good you're a good kid, morty. 
morty: geez! 
rick: y-you're a good you're a good kid. passes out 
morty: oh my god! 
rick: snores 
morty: w-w-what the hell? what a life. 
[open aerial view/zoom on the smith home] 
(morty, rick, and jerry) 
(everything is frozen besides morty, rick and summer. morty is vacuuming jerry with a hand vac.) 
enter: summer) 
summer: hurry up morty, grampa's about to unfreeze time. you know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom. 
morty: i know how to vacuum mom and dad, summer, i've been doing it for six months! 
summer: then you've been doing it wrong for six months. oh, my god, is that mildew? 
morty: it's not my fault we froze time on a humid day! 
summer: you have dropped so many balls, man. do you ever get scared grampa rick might make me his new sidekick? 
morty: what? what kind of monster are you? 
summer: a competent one. 
rick: who cares about the belch thing you guys are talking about? the whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. let's do this thing. 
(morty puts shirt on jerry backwards.) 
rick: alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when i unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize. 
morty: our time is gonna be unstable? what does that even mean? 
rick: it means relax and stop being a pussy, morty. i thought you learned that by now. it also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards. 
morty: wait a minute, what? 
rick: and away we go! 
(rick unfreezes time.) 
(mr. benson falls off the roof.) 
morty: uh, did we ever put that mattress under mr. benson? 
rick: shhh, morty! 
(jerry opens the door angrily) 
jerry:... a thing or two about... wait, what? was the house...? when we pulled up i could have sworn the house was completely trashed. 
rick: negative visualization, jerry. it explains a lot about where you're at. hi, sweety. 
beth: hi, dad. 
(summer and morty recoil from beth as she approaches to hug rick) 
beth: summer, morty, are you okay? 
morty: w-we just missed you a lot. 
summer: yeah, we missed you so much. too much to hug you though. 
(rick motions summer and morty behind him.) 
rick: yeah it would literally destroy them. now listen, why do why do why why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream, (rick puts a rubber band around a rolled up wad of cash) go out there and get some ice creams. here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. i'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. you guys go nuts. 
jerry: this better not be a bribe. if i find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. i'll get my jacket. 
beth: sweety, is your shirt on backwards? 
<simultaneously--- summer: gasp 
morty: oh! 
rick: uh oh. 
<hyphens>------------> jerry: yeah, i like it this way. i'm not stupid. 
<simultaneously--- morty: phew... 
summer: exhales 
<hyphens>------------> rick: man that guy is the red grin grumble to pretending he knows what's going on. (morty and summer laugh) oh you agree, huh? (summer funny) you like that red grin grumble reference? (summer yeah.) well guess what? i made him up. you really are your father's children. think for yourselves, don't be sheep. 
[intro sequence] 
[transition to outside morty's house] 
(mr. benson is being loaded into an ambulance.) 
[transition to inside morty's house] 
summer: god, i feel terrible. 
rick: yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be. (rick opens refrigerator)[transition to inside refrigerator] one minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam! 
[transition to inside morty's house] 
morty: uh, just to be clear, it was summer's job to put the mattress under- 
summer: (interrupting) uh, what? it was your job, morty. (summer pokes morty.) 
morty: nuh uh! 
summer: yeah huh! 
rick: actually, sorry summer, i gotta back the m bomb on this one. i remember the conversation. we told morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under mr. benson. 
morty: boom! in your face summer! you really dropped the ball, man. 
summer: shut up morty, you vindictive little turd! 
morty: you shut up you big... female asshole! 
(alternate selves first appear) 
alternate morty: hey, don't shove me! 
summer: i didn't! 
morty: you didn't what? 
alternate summer: what's your problem? 
morty: what's yours? 
alternate summer: shut up! 
morty: you shut up! 
rick: whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell? 
(time splits into two - alternate timelines will be ordered from top to bottom, left to right.) 
all ricks: oh god, oh no, what did you guys just do? 
summer 1: what do you mean? 
summer 2: what could we do? 
all summers: wait, what am i saying? 
rick: belch were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now? 
all mortys: oh man... i don't feel good. 
morty 1: am i me? i think so. 
morty 2: a-am i talking right now? 
all mortys: wait, who said that? 
all ricks: alright both of you, just don't move, don't speak, don't think. i have to check something. 
summer 1: what should we do morty? 
summer 2: i'm gonna help grampa. 
morty 1: let's see if he needs help. 
morty 2: what do you mean you're gonna help him. 
summer 1: ugh, i can help too. 
[transition to inside rick's garage] 
all mortys: what's going on rick? 
all summers: what's happening grampa? 
all ricks: shut up! (rick turns on a monitor) oh crap are you kidding me? two dots? this never needs to be more than one dot. the two of you made us uncertain! 
morty 1: what do you mean? 
morty 2: what? in english? 
summer 1: what? english please? 
summer 2: what are you talking about? 
all ricks: our time is fractured. you two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. w-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. we're entirely hypothetical. 
all mortys: but i thought there were infinite timelines. 
all ricks: we're not on any timeline, dummy. look. 
(rick opens the garage door, revealing floating cats, trees and islands.) 
all mortys: oh, my god! 
all summers: are those cats? 
all ricks: i assume they're schrodinger's cats. a-actually, i assume they both are and aren't, just like us. 
summer 1 morty 2: is the world gone? where are mom and dad? 
all ricks: mom and dad? get your head out of your family's ass. the three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. your parents get to exist. they're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their sh t marriage. 
[transition to inside jerry's car] 
jerry: cold stone creamery is the best. what should we do with our remaining twenty dollars? 
beth: you realize they sing no matter how much you tip. 
(jerrry hits a deer.) 
beth: holy shit! what happened? 
jerry: i hit a deer! w-we have to tell the cops you were driving. 
beth: w-what? 
jerry: this is rum raisin! 
(beth hands jerry her ice cream, gets out of the car and goes over to the deer.) 
beth: it's still alive. 
jerry: well, do we-do i uh, get a big rock? or-- 
beth: it's not an armadillo, asshole! 
jerry: i thought that's what a man's supposed to say, it's not like i could have actually done it. 
beth: if we were near a hospital, i could treat it, but i-i think we have to just- 
jerry: it's okay, this is just something that happens. and even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon. 
beth: so... 
jerry: well don't different animals- 
beth: require different levels of skill to keep alive? 
jerry: oh god... 
beth: get the deer in the car, jerry. 
jerry: yes beth. 
[transition to inside rick's garage] 
all ricks: this is why you don't freeze time, you guys. it's incredibly irresponsible. 
morty 1: and you did it so you could clean the house after a party. 
morty 2: and you did it so you could clean the house after a party? 
all ricks: look, there's no time to hold me accountable, morty. like literally no time. look around. uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. eventually everything either is or isn't. and we've got about four hours to be is . 
morty 1: or... 
morty 2: or? 
all ricks: we isn't 
all ricks: alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that i didn't nail this, i'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time. 
morty 1 summer 2: how do you know you're gonna- 
all ricks: whatever you're asking, the answer is i'm amazing. and away we go! 
(rick presses a button, the timelines almost merge) 
rick: huh, what do you know, it's working 
summer 1: ow, ow ouch! 
morty 2: whoa, ow, ow. 
rick: oh shit. 
(realities separate again) 
all ricks: what the hell is wrong with you two!? i i m i m i mean you four!? 
all mortys and summer 2: that hurt! that was painful... 
all ricks: good i'm glad it was painful. you do deserve it! i saw you, you're both belch all over the damn place. we've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum f ing wind? what the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? your brand of zit cream? which chair to sit in while i do everything? come on, spit it out! 
all mortys: well you don't exactly make it easy, rick! 
morty 1: you make fun of me all the time and now summer's doing it too! 
morty 2: you're always picking on me and now you got someone to kiss your ass! 
summer 1: me? what about you? would you get more excited to see me fail? you want grampa all to yourself! 
summer 2: me? you're just as mean to me because you're jealous, because you want grampa all to yourself! 
all ricks: alright, cool it, i see what's happening here. you're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be grampa's favorite. i can fix this. morty sit here, summer, you sit here. now listen, i know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as grampa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. yeah, i can prove it mathematically. actually, let me grab my whiteboard. this has been a long time coming anyway. 
[transition to outside animal hospital.] 
[transition to inside animal hospital.] 
beth: emergency, wounded deer coming in. 
[transition to inside animal hospital operating room.] 
(vet is taking a snake's pulse.) 
vet: three. excuse me, you can't be back here. 
beth: i'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. nurse, please move that snake. 
vet: that's my nurse, and as a horse surgeon, i'm sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs- 
beth: as a vet, i'm sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out, it's time to save a life! 
vet: geez... 
(vet removes snake from operating table. beth and jerry place deer on operating table.) 
beth: that's odd, this deer's wounded. 
jerry: uh, yeah, i was there, you don't have to rub it in. 
beth: i mean it's been shot. with a gun. 
hunter: my gun. 
vet: may i help you, sir? 
hunter: no, but you can stop helping this deer. i shot it before these two hit it with their car and i followed them when they hauled it off. this deer belongs to me. 
beth: 
vet: look, i don't know what the law says about this, but i took an oath that i would let no animal come to harm. except when sterilizing, aborting or euthenizing them and also when eating them at almost any meal. 
hunter: i'm calling my lawyer. i hope for all our sakes you're as bad a surgeon as i am a hunter. 
beth: in your dreams, bitch! scalpel! 
[transition to inside rick's garage.] 
all ricks: so in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. and i honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because i don't go by height or age, i go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. alright, everything resolved? everybody nice and certain about their position in my world? 
all mortys and all summers: yes. 
all ricks: alright, perfect. sit still, belch arms down, i'm gonna do this again, this time, be like grampa. 
morty 2: you mean drunk? 
rick 2: what's that? you got something to say? 
rick 1: and away we go! 
morty 2: no. 
rick 2: and away we go! 
all ricks: huh, that's weird. oh, my god. 
all summers: what? 
all ricks: that son of a bitch is gonna kill me! 
rick 2: follicle unfeeling sociopath. don't you get it? he thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. he probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. i have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too. the difference is i would never do it! until now... 
rick 1: don't you get it? don't you get it? the other rick isn't trying to merge us anymore. he thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. he probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. i have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too. the difference is i would never do it! until now... 
all mortys: rick what the hell are you doing? 
all ricks: saving our lives. after he takes me out he's gonna be coming for you! 
all summers: who? 
all ricks: me! 
rick 2: you see that? get down. 
all summers: ahh! 
all mortys: whoa whoa! 
rick 1: i told you he's a psycho! 
rick 2: he's lost it. the time fracture must have made him crazy! 
rick 1: i don't know what to do! i don't know what to do! 
summer 2: oh crap! 
(reality splits into 4 parts) 
all ricks: oh god, now there's three of them, we're outnumbered! get in the cupboards! wait, don't don't do that, they'll know... wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don't really. aaaah is this what you want you sick fucks? you wanna see children die? 
[transition to inside animal hospital operating room.] 
beth: you son of a bitch, you don't stop living until i say so! 
lawyer: michael. 
vet: who's this now? 
hunter: my lawyer. 
lawyer: i'm here to notify you ma'am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter's property, regardless of how far it runs, or who intercepts it before it dies. it's called brad's law. we can't make you stop the surgery, but at this point you're performing it on venison. 
hunter: actually, i've decided not to eat it. all this fear and conflict. i'm sure it's ruined the meat. i'm just gonna use the head for my rec room wall. 
jerry: she normally works on horses. 
beth: jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the fuck out of here! i will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back! 
vet: jesus... 
[transition to inside rick's garage.] 
all ricks: shh shh... i know where you are, you creepy old monster... i know how you think! oh, is this where you think i'm going? you think i'm standing here? well maybe you're right! 
(morty knocks rick out with a fire extinguisher) 
all summers: holy shit, now what? 
all mortys: well if all of me knocked out all the ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized? 
all summers: right. 
all mortys: okay... so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain. 
all summers: right... 
all mortys: i think i'm certain we're f'd in the a. 
[cut to black] 
[transition to outside the house in schrodinger cat space] 
all ricks: oh god, my head. what did you guys do? 
all mortys: we put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture. 
all summers: you tried to kill yourself! 
all ricks: only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! guys, i don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. well actually, i do expect you to understand that, it's basic math. c-could someone just let me out of here? if i die in a cage i lose a bet. 
all summers: well is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore? 
all ricks: ah, for god's sake, alright here, give me the time crystal. 
all mortys: w-what're you doing? 
all ricks: calling myself. here, listen, belch it'll probably go to voice mail since, you know, i'm calling myself. 
all rick phones: hello, rick here. 
all ricks: don't fall for it, it's a bit. 
all rick phones: just kidding, haha! you just got ricked. you've reached rick's voicemail, you know what to do beep . 
all ricks: hey rick, it's rick. listen, i'm sorry about earlier. no hard feelings. i know you know i mean it too. take it easy. whoa. damn, look at this, i'm blown up. three new voicemails. voicemail repeats yeah yeah, i heard this one. voicemail repeats two more times you get the idea belch we're cool now. 
all summers: okay, well we're still not gonna let you out of this crate. 
all ricks: fine i'll just do it myself. 
all mortys: if you could get out that whole time why didn't you? 
all ricks: because i waited until i was certain it was what i wanted to do, morty. that's the difference between you and me. i'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds. 
all mortys: you know, geez rick, y y you're really tearing into me right now. you know, words hurt. 
(testicle monster a floats into view in a bubble.) 
morty 1: oh, my god!

summer 1: it's a monster! 
summer 4: it's a monster! 
testicle monster a: ey, ye ey, quit yellin'quit yellin'. 
summer 1: screams 
summer 4: oh, my god... 
morty 2 3 and 4: screams 
testicle monster a: what the fuck?! your time is all ripped up to hell! you broke your time, twice! 
all ricks: sigh 
testicle monster a: how did this happen? 
summers 2 3: yeah, but we don't even know, the first time... 
morty 1 4: who's that brother newman time elf? 
testicle monster a: shut the fuck up! oh, damn, i'm from the 4th dimension. i can hear all o'y'all. now let's just see what we got here for a second. 
all ricks: groan 
testicle monster a: ay, damn it, were you tryin'to use this to-oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this? how you think you gonna move time while you're standin in it you dumn ass three-dimensional monkey ass dummies? 
all mortys: oh way to go, rick. 
all summers: yeah grampa, way to go. 
all ricks: oh, what you're just gonna listen to this guy now? he's got a giant testicle for a head! he came here in a bubble. for all we know he could be the david berkowitz of nutsack land. 
testicle monster a: shut up. here, put these on. they'll sync your possibilities up so i can bring you back to certain time. y'all just-just negligent, now ay, ay, ay, the three of you, put your collars on! 
summer 1 2 and 3: what are you talking about? 
morty 1 2 and 3: we have them on. 
rick 1 2 and 3: uh, we did... 
rick 4: we're not wearing collars. 
testicle monster a: exactly, because you're being obstinate. 
rick 1 2 and 3: belch what? 
morty 1 2 and 3: we did! 
summer 1 2 and 3: they're on right now. 
rick 4: alright, fine. summer, morty, put'em on. 
(alternate timelines merge into one) 
rick: yes, we're back, problem solved. 
summer: yes, we're back to our own time. 
morty: yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it. 
testicle monster a: yeah, now keep those collars on so you don't break your weak ass time again. 
rick: how long exactly do we have to wear these things? they're really embarassing. 
testicle monster a: well since you're goin'to time prison, i'd say you can keep em on forever. 
summer: time prison? 
testicle monster a: yeah, well i don't know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way you dumb ass, assin'ass asses could ever have one, is if it was stolen. 
summer: you stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters? 
rick: i would have been happy to pay for it, summer, but they don't exactly sell them at costco. besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. get him! 
testicle monster a: ututututut! you'd better keep back! man this will turn your ass into a third trimester fetus from 30 yards. 
[transition to inside animal hospital operating room.] 
vet: hmm... 
beth: isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure? 
lawyer: that's right mrs. smith, whispers give in to your anger. neglect that deer. 
jerry: honey, it's gonna be okay. these men are from the cervine institute of elk, moose deer and stag. they can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends. 
vet: i guess that's the end of that. 
lawyer: there is just one more thing. according to this state's veterinarian statute, this animal can't be transferred until the current attending physician verbally confirms their inability to provide adequate care. you heard the man horse doctor, you have to say you couldn't hack it. 
jerry: we did it... 
[transition to inside rick's garage.] 
testicle monster a: (on phone) uh-huh, no motha-no, earth, dude, i'm talking'bout, yeah, with the dinosaurs. no, if you've get to the dolphin people, you've gone too far. alright man, i'll talk to you later, okay. (hangs up) you know what they do with 3rd dimensional life forms in time prison? same thing they do in every other prison, only forever. 
morty: why are you doing this? 
testicle monster a: you think i wanna be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life? i got ambitions man, bringin'you guys in is my ticket up. 
rick: what if i told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you? 
testicle monster a: you really think i'm that stupid? 
rick: alright, hear me out on this. you're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. well in that case there's 100 chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you. 
testicle monster a: i cannot argue that. 
(rick hits the creature with a wrench and grabs the organic gun he was holding) 
rick: ah, god, gross and weird! 
(rick drops the gun and it crawls toward the street) 
testicle monster a: chris! 
(the gun/chris runs into the road and is run over by a car) 
testicle monster a: you killed my gun! 
rick: summer, morty, take off your collars! 
testicle monster a: what? what the hell are you doing? 
rick: good question. i suppose the answer is i'm not certain! 
testicle monster a: oh, no, what are you doin'? 
(time splits into 2 timelines) 
rick 1: i have no idea! 
rick 2: i'm not sure. 
(time splits into 4 timelines) 
all ricks off sync: maybe i will, maybe i won't. 
(time splits into 8 timelines) 
all ricks off sync: i'm really uncertain about everything, even kicking your ass! 
testicle monster a: lis-ay, to, ah. but these arms are vestigial. now you poked me where an eye would have been about six million years ago. 
all summers off sync: come on, let's help grampa. 
all mortys off sync: yeah. i'm like a hundred percent not sure about anything. 
(time splits twice, now 32 timelines) 
summers: beat his ass! 
summers: get him! 
summers: beat him up! 
[zooms into only show one timeline, timeline 23] 
morty 23: kick his ass, rick! 
(ricks, mortys, and summers hit testicle monster a one last time, he falls back and his head explodes.) 
testicle monster a: ow, i'm defeated... 
summer 23: what's happening? 
rick 23: time is falling apart, we've got to get back to certainty, quick! give me your collars! 
morty 23: oh man, don't you have to fix, like, thirty of them? 
rick 23: morty, i have to fix three of them, and then there's thirty-one other versions of me that have to also fix three for a total of 96. i'm not an idiot. i know how to be decisive, now hand me that (phillips flathead) screwdriver. actually, make it a (phillips flathead). 
(time splits into 64 timelines) 
all ricks off sync: oh, shit. 
[transition to inside jerry's car] 
jerry: look, i know i was kind of a nuisance today. i know it's my fault we hit the deer, and i know you wanted to be the one to save it. 
beth: whatever. how petty would i have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego? 
jerry: hmm... you'd have to be pretty petty. but you'd still be the woman i married. 
beth: where are we going? 
jerry: one last stop. 
beth: where's the helicopter? 
jerry: there is no helicopter and there is no cervine institute. 
beth: but the top deer surgeon... 
jerry: i'm looking at her. thanks for f. d.'ing me up like that. 
cold stone employee: you'd better get moving, these lights are designed for basic ice cream work, they're not gonna last all night. 
beth: i need five minutes. 
(short slow-panning montage of surgery) 
beth: jerry, this was the most romantic weekend i've ever had. 
jerry: thanks to cold stone creamery. 
cold stone employee: you're welcome.

(zoom into timeline 30) 
presumably all ricks: okay, we're out of time. it's ironic, huh? 
morty 30: rick! 
rick 30: what's goin'on? 
morty 30: the collar, oh, the latch is broken! it won't latch closed around my neck! 
(zoom pan to timeline 28) 
mortys: what's wrong, how come our collars aren't green? 
ricks: obviously because someone doesn't know how to put his collar on and one of me is stuck trying to help him. 
mortys: don't blame this on me, you're the one that couldn't fix a latch! 
(zoom pan to timeline 30) 
rick 30: what are you talking about, it's not broken, morty, i fixed it, just put it on! 
morty 30: it won't close, it's broken! 
rick 30: fine, bring it here. 
morty 30: ooh, ooh, rick! 
(zoom pan to timeline 15) 
ricks: oh, really, morty? well i'm sorry, i'm not the one that's so fucking uncertain about everything! 
mortys: you know what i'm certain of, rick? i've really made up my mind about this, i never wanna see you again! 
ricks: you're never gonna see anything again you little dummy! you killed us! 
(zoom pan to timeline 30) 
rick 30: goddammit! 
morty 30: ooh 
rick 30: morty where's your collar i'll fix it 
morty 30: i dropped it 
ricks: what the hell? what have you done to me, morty? 
rick 30: i'm okay with this. be good morty. be better than me. bullsh t the other collar! i'm not okay with this! i am not okay with this! oh, sweet jesus please let me live. oh, my god i i've gotta fix this thing, please god in heaven, please, god, oh lord, hear my prayers. yes! fuck you god! not today, bitch. 
ricks: please, god, if there's a hell, please be merciful to me. 
rick 30: yes i did it! there is no god! in your face. one dot, motherfuckers! 
morty: yes, oh, yes, yes! 
summer: woohoo! whoo! whoo! 
morty: oh, that was a close call. oh yeah, do it rick, do it right. 
rick: you know what i'm talking about, oh yeah. i'm gonna do the cabbage patch, morty. check me out i'm doing the cabbage patch dance. it's a classic dance, remember, like this. oh shit look at that. 
morty: do the cabbage patch. do do do the dance. 
summer: hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here? 
morty: i don't know. i think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. it's hard to keep straight now that i have sixty-three other memories of everything. 
rick: yeah. 
morty: but i feel like one of the sixty-four ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, i think. 
rick: shut up, morty. the last time you felt something, we all almost died. you little s piece of shit. 
beth: hey guys, we're home. 
(summer and morty run up and hug beth and jerry, respectively.) 
morty summer: mom, dad! 
jerry: um, hold the phone, where did you guys get those necklaces from? uh, lady gaga, table for three, am i right? 
beth: laughs 
jerry: are you guys power rangers? but only on one small part of your necks? hey, do those things need batteries? were they included? clean up in the fruit isle! not in a homophobic way though, they're just fruity necklaces is all i was saying. 
beth: laughing i'm gonna pee my pants. 
morty: doesn't feel so good, does it? 
rick: no it doesn't. it hurts. 
beth: i'm gonna pee-hee-hee. 
jerry: somebody call the planet of tron, we have three tron people over here. but seriously, are these halloween costumes? are you going as motorcycles? with green headlights instead of normal ones? are you dogs? robot dogs? gosh, you guys are lame. are those chokers from the 90's? what is this, a 90's nostalgia thing? are you guys in that movie the craft with fairuza balk?

testicle monster b: you know how much time is past the dinosaurs? half of all time!

principal vagina: principal vagina here--don't let the name fool you, i'm very much in charge--reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance, i don't know how many times i have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home, 
jessica: hey, 
principal vagina: the flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration, you don't bring dead babies to passover, 
morty: okay, here we go, h-hey, jessica, 
jessica: uh... what's up, morty? 
brad: what are you doing? 
morty: um... 
brad: wait, wait, were you about to talk... to her? 
morty: well... i mean, i was thinking about it, 
brad: dude, stay in your league, look at how hot she is, you don't see me going to a bigger school in a wealthier district and hitting on their prettiest girl, 
jessica: gee, thanks, brad, i throw balls far, you want good words? date a languager, 
jerry: try not to worry about it, morty, you're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after brad's out of shape, 
morty: you're missing the point, dad, i don't want girls, i want jessica, 
jerry: ah, well, i remember feeling that way about a young lady named"your mom,"and that's not an urban diss, your mom was my jessica, i remember the first time i saw her, i thought-- 
rick:"i should get her pregnant, and then she'll have to marry me," 
jerry: i beg your pardon, rick--inappropriate, 
rick: sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school, i'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread, 
jerry: my marriage is fine, thank you, 
rick: jerry, it's your house--whatever you say it is is how it is--but i think a blind man could see that beth is looking for the door, i barely have a reason to care, and even i noticed, 
morty: come on, rick! don't talk about my parents like that, 
rick: listen, morty, i hate to break it to you, but what people call"love"is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed, it hits hard, morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage, i did it, your parents are gonna do it, break the cycle, morty, rise above, focus on science,[slurps] 
morty: all right, well, i'm gonna go get dressed for the dance, 
jerry: yeah, i'm just going to... check on your mom, 
rick: morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh? i'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, morty, it's gonna be great, 
morty: hey, listen, rick, y-y-you know how you said that, you know, love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier? well, i was thinking, you know, w-w--could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing? you know, like, maybe make some sort of love potion or something? 
rick: morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me, hand me the screwdriver, 
morty: you know what? no, rick! i'm not gonna hand you the screwdriver, i-i'm not gonna hand you anything ever again, rick! i'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing, w-w-w-w-w-what about me, rick? w-w-w-w-why can't you just help me out once--once--for once? 
rick:[groans] you're growing up fast, morty, you're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass, listen, this is called oxytocin, i extracted it from a vole, do you know what a vole is, morty? you know what a vole is? it's a--it's a rodent that mates for life, morty, this is the chemical released in a mammal's brain, you know, that makes it fall in love, all right, morty, i just got to combine it with some of your dna, 
morty: oh, well, okay, 
rick: a hair, morty, i need one of your hairs, this isn't"game of thrones," 
morty: ow! 
rick: all right, morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever, are you happy now, morty? 
morty: heck, yeah! thank you, grandpa rick, hey, there's no... dangers or anything, or side effects, right? 
rick: w-w-w-what am i, a hack? go nuts, morty, it's foolproof, eh, unless she has the flu, 
jerry: beth, do y-you still love me? 
beth: ugh, what kind of question is that? 
jerry: the"yes or no"kind? 
beth: jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes? 
jerry: yes, 
beth: are you gonna build them? 
jerry: no, 
beth: then what good was the"yes"? 
jerry: wait, i-is loving me the house or the homeless people? 
beth: loving you is work, jerry--hard work, like building a homeless shelter--nobody wants to say no to doing it, but some people put the work in, so, what do you say? do you see me working here? does this conversation seem tedious to me? 
jerry: sort of, 
beth: then i obviously sort of love you, don't i? so stop asking, and maybe i'll love you more, crap, they need me at the horse hospital, 
jerry: puh! this late? 
beth: the racetrack had a starlight derby, there was a seven-horse collision, and davin's there alone,

rick: i didn't realize when i gave you that serum that jessica had the flu--you know, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-that might have been valuable information for me, morty, 
morty: what the hell is going on, rick? 
rick: what does it look like? t-t-t-the serum is piggybacking on the virus, it's gone airborne, morty, 
morty: oh, crap, what are we gonna do, rick? 
rick: it's gonna be fine, morty, relax, i whipped up and antidote, it's based on praying-mantis dna, you know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, morty, i mean, they--they mate once, and then they, you know, decapitate the partner, i mean, it's a whole ritual, it's really gruesome and totally opposite, there's no love at all, i-i-i basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus, it should neutralize the whole thing, morty, it'll all be over very shortly, 
[ indistinct shouting ] 
rick: uh, by the way, morty, i know you didn't ask or anything, but i'm not interested in having sex with you, these serums, they don't work on anybody related to you genetically,

rick: yeah, i don't know what i was thinking, mantises are they opposite of voles? i mean, obviously, dna's a little more complicated than that, you know what, though, morty? this right here's gonna do the trick, baby, it's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden retriever, and just a smidge of dinosaur, should add up to normal humanity,

morty: what, morty, you want me to show you my math? i'm sorry--a-are you the scientist or are you the kid that wanted to get laid? 
davin:[exhales deeply] well, i'm glad we saved all those horses, but i'm almost sorry we're finished, 
beth: yes, it's satisfying work, 
davin: unh-unh-unh, it's, uh--it's more than the work, i love being in that sterilized room, sealed off from the world, it's the only time i can really think... and feel, 
[ slow music plays ] 
beth: hmm, uh, what are you doing? 
davin: i'm playing african dream pop, what do you do after a long night? 
[ click ] 
beth: oh, ha, um, hey, i b--i'd better get going, um, jerry's been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff, 
davin: beth... 
beth: what is it, davin? 
davin: just once, i'd like to know--[sneezes] w-w-what it was like to give your son a bath, 
beth: what?! 
davin: what does morty's skin smell like? how soft...[grunts] how soft are his privates? 
beth: let go of me, davin! 
davin:[roars] take me to morty, 
jerry:[grunts] 
davin: you're not morty, 
jerry: no, i'm mr, crowbar, and this is my friend, who is also a crowbar, 
davin: that's... stupid, 
jerry:[grunting] yeah? well, look where being smart got you, 
beth: jerry! thank god! 
jerry: god? god's turning people into insect monsters, beth, i'm the one beating them to death, thank me, 
beth: thank you, jerry, thank you, 
rick: take a good look down there, morty, and soak it in, because, you know, once i pull this lever, it's all back to normal, 
morty: just do it already, 
rick: well, technically, morty, there's no rush, i mean, you know, o-once it's fixed, it's done, it's fixed, you know, we could--we could just enjoy it for a little bit, i mean, l-l-l-look at how crazy it is, i mean, morty, w-w-when's the next time you're gonna see something like this? i mean, soak it in, you know? it's--it's pretty neat, it's pretty interesting, 
morty: that's it, rick! i'm pulling the lever,[grunts] 
rick: w-what do we have here, morty? looks like i was right and you were wrong, huh? i-i-i-i-i-i-i bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh? i-i-i bet you feel like the world's smallest man that you were doubting me about this whole thing, morty, 
morty: oh, rick, something's not right, yeah, you, you're not right--ever, 
morty: no, no! look, you idiot! 
[ all screaming ] [ all speaking native language ] [ all groaning ] [ all ululating ] 
rick: bet you're loving this, morty, this must be the best day of your life, you get to be the mayor of i told you town,[slurps] you're welcome,[slurps] 
jerry: hold on, 
[ engine revs, tires squeal ] [ gun cocks ] 
jerry: i wish that shotgun was my penis, 
beth: if it were, you could call me ernest hemingway, 
jerry: i don't get it, and i don't need to, 
[ both moaning ] 
summer: mom! dad! 
both: summer! 
beth:[sighs] 
jerry: where's morty? 
summer: i don't know, do you think grandpa rick had something to do with this? 
jerry: it's not fair to assume that, summer, 
beth: oh, not fair? give me a break, he is a selfish, irresponsible ass, and he left my mother, a real man stands by his woman, 
[ both moaning ] 
summer: tchoo, tchoo-tchoo-tchoo, tchoo-tchoo, 
rick: boy, morty, i really cronenberged the world up, didn't i? we got a whole planet of cronenbergs walking around down there, morty, a-at least they're not in love with you anymore, though, that's a huge step in the right direction, 
morty: oh, my god! it's a living nightmare! how could you be so irresponsible, rick? 
rick: me irresponsible?! you--all i wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver, morty! you're the one who wanted to be--wanted me to buckle down and make you up a... roofie-juice serum so you could roofie that poor girl at your school, i mean, g--w-w-w-w-w--w--are you kidding me, morty? you're gonna try to take the high road on this one? y-y-y-y-you're a little creep, morty, y-you're a--you're--you're--you're just a little creepy... creep person, 
morty: all right, fine, i should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum, i'm willing to accept my part of the blame for this, rick, but i'll tell you something--you know what? you got to accept your part of the blame! i'm not the one who fouled up the serum! i'm not the one who--who--who--who haphazardly, you know, mixed a bunch of nonsense together and created a bunch of cronenbergs! you got to fix this, rick! 
rick: all right, all right, morty, you know, w-w-w-we are in a pretty deep hole, here, but i do have one emergency solution that i can use that'll kind of put everything back to normal, relatively speaking, here, morty, put this on while i do a little bit of scouting, 
[ birds chirping ] 
morty: wow, rick, i got to say--you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time, i mean, i-i really thought that the whole place was gonna be messed up for good, but here, you did it--y-y-you--you--you figured out that crazy solution, like you always do, whoo! that's some great luck, 
rick: come on, morty, luck had nothing to do with it, i'm great, that's the real reason, now, morty, what do you say, buddy? will you hand me a screwdriver so i can finish my ionic dis--defibulizer? 
morty: sure thing, rick, here's a screwdriver, 
rick: all right, morty, thank you very much, we got one screw turn... and two screw turns... and... all right, morty, here we are, 
morty: oh, my god, rick! is that us?! w-w-w-we're dead! what is going on, rick? i'm freaking out! 
rick: calm down, morty! look at me! calm down, morty! 
morty: no, i can't deal with this! 
rick: calm yourself, morty, 
morty: i can't deal with this, rick! 
rick: morty, calm down, morty, 
rick: you got to calm down, morty, 
morty: w-w-w-w-we're ripped apart! 
rick: shut up and listen to me! it's fine, everything is fine, there's an infinite number of realities, morty, and in a few dozen of those, i got lucky and turned everything back to normal, i just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die around this time, now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine, we're not skipping a beat, morty,-now, help me with these bodies, 
morty: this is insane, 
rick: look, morty, i'll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay? i mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to me--i mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up, 
morty: rick, what about the reality we left behind? 
rick: what about the reality where hitler cured cancer, morty? the answer is don't think about it, it's not like we can do this every week, anyways, we get three or four more of these, tops, now, pick up your dead self and come on, haste makes waste, i-i-i don't suppose you've considered this detail, but obviously, if i hadn't screwed up as much as i did, we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're welcome,

summer: you know, the thing about a shark... he's got lifeless eyes... black eyes, like a doll's eyes, when he comes at ya, he doesn't seem to be living until he bites ya, and then the--the blood, and the red, and the water... 
jerry:[sighs] you ever wonder what happened to rick and morty? 
beth: sometimes, but, i'm ashamed to admit, now that they're gone, i'm finally happy, 
cronenberg rick: here we are, cronenberg morty--a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged, we'll fit right in, cronenberg morty, it'll be like we never even left cronenberg world, 
cronenberg morty: yeah, cronenberg rick, but, you know, i'm gonna miss cronenberg world, because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning, you know? i mean, i-i wish we hadn't genetically ruined cronenberg world beyond repair like we did, you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people just walking around, 
cronenberg rick: don't you worry about that sort of thing, cronenberg morty, let's go make ourselves at home, huh? 
[open on morty combing his hair in the bathroom mirror. he is wearing an orange sweater vest, a yellow dress shirt, and an olive tie.] 
pickle rick: (offscreen, in the distance) morty. 
morty: rick? 
[morty stops combing, looks around, then continues combing] 
pickle rick: (offscreen, in the distance) morty! 
morty: rick? 
pickle rick: (offscreen, in the distance) hey, mooorty! 
morty: rick? are you far away, or are you inside something? 
[morty opens a cabinet beneath the bathroom sink] 
morty: is this a camera? 
[morty tries to look inside his comb for a camera] 
morty: is everything a camera? 
[morty nervously glances around] 
pickle rick: (offscreen, in the distance) morty, the garage, morty. come to the garage! 
[transition to to morty entering the garage. there is a pickle and a screwdriver on rick's work bench] 
pickle rick: morty? 
morty: rick? w-where are you? 
pickle rick: on my work bench, morty. 
morty: are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me? 
pickle rick: flip the pickle over. 
morty: what, i'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something. 
pickle rick: come on, flip the pickle, morty. you're not gonna regret it. the payoff is huge. 
[morty hesitantly picks up the screwdriver and turns the pickle over. the pickle has rick's face on it] 
pickle rick: i turned myself into a pickle, morty! boom! big reveal-i'm a pickle. what do you think about that? i turned myself into a pickle! w-what are you just staring at me for, bro. i turned myself into a pickle, morty! 
morty: and? 
pickle rick:"and"? what more do you want tacked on to this? i turned myself into a pickle, and 9 11 was an inside job? 
morty: was it? 
pickle rick: who cares, morty? global acts of terrorism happen every day. uh, here's something that's never happened before-i'm a pickle. i'm pickle rick! 
morty: are you going to, i mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick? 
pickle rick: i don't do magic, morty, i do science. one takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner. 
morty: well, can you move? can you fly? 
pickle rick: i wouldn't be much of a pickle if i could. 
morty: all right, well, do pickles live forever or-- 
pickle rick: morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. i'm a pickle. 
morty: i-i'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. why anyone would do this. 
pickle rick: the reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't. 
[beth and summer enter the garage from the house. beth is wearing a midi mahogany pencil dress while summer is wearing a shorter pink dress with a hot pink jacket, along with black stockings and black heels] 
beth: morty, we have to get going, or we're gonna be late. where's your grandpa? 
pickle rick: right here, sweetie. i'm a pickle! 
beth: what?! why would you--look, we're running late. we have to go. 
pickle rick: where are you guys going? 
beth: we have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you. 
pickle rick: oh, my god. beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. geez, oh, man. i'm a pickle. i mean, i don't know if i can, ooh, geez. 
morty: rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling? 
beth: morty! 
pickle rick: it's okay, beth. i understand morty's suspicion. i've misled him before. morty, turn me so we're making eye contact. 
[morty turns pickle rick's face so that it is facing him] 
pickle rick: morty, i assure you, i would never"find a way"to"get out of"family therapy. i hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes. 
summer: can't you just turn yourself back into a human? 
pickle rick: great question, summer. the unfortunate answer is i did this to challenge myself. and it could take hours or even days before i'm able to figure out how to return to human form. but, i mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go. 
beth: nobody needs anything! okay, it's fine. i mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay? 
morty: hey, rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? and why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy? 
pickle rick: well, morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation. 
[beth cuts off the syringe and takes it] 
beth: enough. kids, it's time to go. we don't want to be late. 
[beth puts the syringe in her purse] 
pickle rick: w-w-what are you doing there, beth? what are you doing there, sweetie? 
beth: well, i mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. how's that gonna help? 
pickle rick: can't argue with that. 
beth: great. we'll see you later. 
[beth, summer, and morty enter the car.] 
pickle rick: hey, hey, be careful with that. it's for something else. it's really important, so don't break it. 
[beth drives away with summer and morty. they all exit.] 
pickle rick: okay, i may have fucked up here. dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. t-t-tah, tah.[clicks tongue] 
[izzy walks in through the open garage door and jumps onto rick's work bench. she sniffs around] 
pickle rick: oh, great. stupid cat. 
[izzy sniffs pickle rick and hisses] 
pickle rick: whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! i know what it looks like to you, izzy, but i'm not a snake! i've seen the youtube videos, i know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes. i'm not a snake! i'm a pickle, i'm a pickle! 
[izzy bats at pickle rick and knocks him off of the work bench, causing him to roll down the driveway] 
pickle rick: whoa! oh! whoa, whoa, whoa! 
[pickle rick is directly facing the sky] 
pickle rick: oh, crap, that sun is bright. 
[pickle rick begins to sweat] 
pickle rick: okay, come on. this can't really be the way i go out. this is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet. 
[pickle rick starts to shrivel up] 
pickle rick: so... hot. this is how i'm gonna die. 
[thunder can be heard and the shadow of a cloud appears overhead. it starts to rain. pickle rick stops shriveling] 
pickle rick: oh, god, moisture. 
[the rain gets heavy and it begins to flood] 
pickle rick: oh, god, the moisture! dial it back, god! dial it back a little bit here! 
[pickle rick starts rolling down the road] 
pickle rick: oh! oh! 
[pickle rick rolls towards a sewer grate] 
pickle rick: oh, god! perpendicular, perpendicular! 
[pickle rick rolls into the sewer grate and falls into the sewer] 
pickle rick: oh, shiiit! oh! oh! oh! 
[pickle rick hits many pipes before eventually falling onto a solid surface. there are bugs crawling around. one bug walks up to a pile of dirt. pickle rick bites his lip and pickle juice comes out. the bug turns around] 
pickle rick: come on. that's it. 
[the bug walks towards pickle rick] 
pickle rick: come get this delicious brine. 
[the bug is in front of pickle rick. pickle rick bites on his head and squeezes it until the bug dies.] 
pickle rick: aah! come on! come on, mother[bleep]! come on! 
[pickle rick licks off the top of the bug's head, revealing its brain. he then licks part of the brain and the bug's leg moves. he rolls onto the bug and licks its brain, moving its legs forward and moving him forward with it] 
pickle rick: yes! 
[transition to to beth, summer, and morty sitting in a waiting room outside of dr. wong's therapy office. beth is reading a magazine, while summer sits with her head resting on her fist. the door to her office reads "dr. wong / family therapy / coprophragia recovery". there is a motivational picture of a man eating a hot dog which reads "courage" underneath it.] 
summer: how is this even family therapy if dad's not invited and grandpa won't come? 
morty: yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog? 
beth: it's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs. the family was told to get counseling by your principal, even though it's not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class. 
[mr. goldenfold enters through dr. wong's door.] 
mr goldenfold: oh, the smith family, minus a dad. you're patients of dr. wong, too? 
beth: temporarily. by order of the school. 
mr goldenfold: me too. how long have you all been eating poop? 
summer: we... have never... eaten poop. 
mr goldenfold: uh, me, neither. say, where did my family get off to? 
[mr. goldenfold exits. dr. wong opens her door and enters the waiting room] 
dr wong: smith family, i'm dr. wong. come on in. 
[beth, summer, and morty exit the waiting room and enter dr. wong's office. dr. wong flips the motivational image over to another motivational image of a nuclear family which reads "dedication". transition to to beth, morty, summer, and dr. wong sitting down in dr. wong's office.] 
dr wong: i was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us? 
beth: he got wrapped up in an experiment. he's a scientist. like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. his work is very-- 
morty: he turned himself into a pickle. 
beth: morty, mom's talking. i'm sorry, i suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here. 
dr wong: does grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot? 
beth: what? no, what kind of question is that? 
dr wong: the kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way. 
beth: oh, jesus christ, one of these. no, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. he's unpredictable and eccentric. the whole family is. speaking of which... 
[beth turns towards summer and morty] 
dr wong: okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. why do we think grandpa turned himself into a pickle? 
[beth rolls her eyes. transition to to pickle rick, who has attached the bug's limbs to his pickle body and has managed to use them to move. he is looking through a grate, and is rubbing the end of one of the bug arms against one of the bars] 
pickle rick: wow. ugh. 
[a rat appears behind the grate and starts scratching at pickle rick, screeching] 
pickle rick: hey, listen, i know this is your world not mine. the sooner i can get out, the sooner i can go back to taking big craps, and you can go back to subsisting on them. 
[the rat breaks open one of the bars and continues to scratch. pickle rick starts to walk backwards.] 
pickle rick: you are one driven rat. could you be a little more driven? to the right. 
[pickle rick scratches at a rope which is attached to a bug's arms which is holding a razor that it lets go of which is propelled upwards which breaks a rubber band which is tied to a sharp broken bottle which falls on the rat's head and chops it off, killing the rat] 
[pickle rick picks up the rat's head] 
pickle rick: yes, yes, yes! come on, come on, come on! fresh, fresh, fresh! 
[a mischief of rats appears behind the bars, also scratching at pickle rick, who is not in their range.] 
pickle rick: whoa, whoa, whoa, was this your friend? don't worry, he died doing what he loved, being a dumb[bleep] ing rat. 
[pickle rick puts the rat's head onto a bottle cap which starts a machine which lifts him up and takes off his bug limbs. the machine then splits open the rat head and rips out its brain, then puts pickle rick down and begins nailing the rat's body parts to pickle rick's pickle body. it then sticks a needle into the brain which connects it to the limbs. pickle rick runs towards the rats and begins killing them.] 
pickle rick: oh, yeah! aaaah! 
[he takes out a machines on his wrists which are loaded with screws. he kills some of the rats. the screws disappear and x-acto blade pop out. he kills more rats. transition to to dr. wong's office.] 
beth: i didn't say my father is perfect, i said his work is important. 
summer: and she's saying what's important is that grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here. 
beth: oh, he did not! 
dr wong: let's do an experiment here. i get the impression this family values science. so raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe. 
[no one raises their hand.] 
dr wong: raise your hand if you know for certain the syringe does not contain anti-pickle serum. 
[beth begins to raise her hand but stops herself.] 
dr wong: beth, your hand did a little thing there. 
beth: do you really not see what's happening here? 
dr wong: tell me. 
beth: well, dr. wong--by the way, racist name--obviously, morty and summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy. 
dr wong: oh, i think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. i think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. i don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. i think it may punish them. i think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings. 
[a short pause] 
beth: fuck you. 
morty: mom! 
summer: mom! 
beth: fuck both of you, too. 
[transition to to pickle rick, fighting a much larger grey rat and beating it up.] 
pickle rick: by the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, i never gave you a name like scar or stripe or goliath. that's because, to me, you aren't special. 
[pickle rick pins the rat to the wall with some screws.] 
pickle rick: you were special to rats. now they're dead. i guess it was me you should have impressed. 
[pickle rick slices open the rat's stomach with his x-acto blade.] 
pickle rick: god damn it, i love myself. 
[pickle rick walks up to a pipe above him. his wrist machines fall off and are replaced with a jet pack. he pulls a hood over his head with a rat's face on it. he turns on the jet pack and flies out of the pipe and out of a toilet.] 
pickle rick: pickle riiick! 
[pickle rick opens the door. it is a bathroom door with a "male" sign on the front. he starts running around and opening various doors and looking in. eventually he runs up to an elevator and tries to jump up to the buttons but cannot reach them. he tries to scale the wall but fails. he pushes a garbage can and a potted plant next to each other in front of the elevator buttons. he jumps off of the garbage can into the potted plant, then jumps into the lid which turns rapidly and propels him up and swings him to the elevator buttons.] 
pickle rick: get that parkour. get that parkour! 
[pickle rick kicks the "down button", then waits on the ground for the elevator. the elevator opens, and three men in black suits with earpieces stand inside. they notice pickle rick and gasp.] 
pickle rick: hey, it's cool. just need to find the nearest exit. 
[the men in the elevator point their guns at pickle rick.] 
pickle rick: whoa, whoa, whoa! no need to freak out. 
[one of the men yells something in a foreign language into his earpiece and all three men start shooting at him. he runs away and they chase after him, still shooting at him.] 
pickle rick: whoa! who in the fuck's toilet is this? 
[transition to to the frontal exterior of the building. it is a rather large light brown building with a stone fence and a plethora of guards surrounding it. an alarm blares. some guards run around to the other side of the building's roof. transition to to a surveillance room where the three agents from the elevator are waiting. the agency director slams open the door.] 
agency director: what is it? 
agent 1: a pickle. a rat. both. 
agent 2: it says it's a scientist. 
agency director: where is it? 
agent 1: it seems to be using the air ducts and the mail tubes to get around. 
[a monitor shows pickle rick climbing into an air duct] 
agent 1: it's been gathering office supplies, we think, to build weaponry. but look what it did on the mezzanine. 
[the monitor shows pickle rick jumping from a potted plant to the trash can to the recycling bin] 
agent 1: it transferred a bottle from the trash to the recycling bin. 
[on the monitor, pickle rick picks up a glass bottle from the trash can, taunts the camera with it, throws it in the recycling bin, then runs off.] 
agent 1: whatever this thing is, it's shaming us. 
agency director: we have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle? 
agent 1: 32 armed guards. he killed two. 
agent 2: it's on the phone. 
[a phone rings and one of the monitors reads "incoming call".] 
agency director: put him on, and locate the phone he's using. 
[agent #2 picks up the phone] 
agency director: hello. 
pickle rick: hi, um, can you, uh (burps) please let me out. 
agency director: your mere presence in this building violates international law. 
[agent #1 walks up to the agency director with a clipboard, which reads "level 3 / room 304" in red pen. he taps the clipboard. the agency director looks at it and nods.] 
agency director: i couldn't let you out even if you hadn't killed two men. 
[transition to to pickle rick. the bottom part of the phone he is using has been dismantled. he attaches a belt around his waist which has batteries in the back of it. 
pickle rick: you should know those men killed themselves. 
agency director: and how is that? 
pickle rick: they didn't (burps) let me out. 
agent 2: solen'ya. 
agency director: shut your mouth and do your jobs, you fucking children! 
pickle rick: uh, is this not a good time or...? 
[agent #1 holds his earpiece up to his ear. he gives a thumbs up to the agency director. on one of the monitors, six agents run up to the door of room 304 with rifles.] 
agency director: some of my men are calling you"solen'ya"the pickle man, an old wives tale. he crawls from bowls of cold soup to steal the dreams of wasteful children. 
[one of the agents on the monitor gives a thumbs up. the agency director pantomimes slicing his neck to agent #1.] 
pickle rick: that'd be a lucky break for you. 
agent 1: go, shoot to kill! 
[transition to to room 304. one of the agents slams open the door, knocking over a water jug above the door which activates a pulley which pulls a string which cuts another string which swings a needle towards the agent's head, killing him instantly. two more agents enter and start to walk in, but fall through the floor onto some spikes, which kill them. the three remaining agents walk in and see this and begin shooting at a pickle which is not pickle rick, but a decoy. they continue to shoot at the pickle until it is completely gone.] 
agent 3: aaah! we got him. 
[transition to back to the surveillance room.] 
agency director: ah. 
agent 1: ah. 
[transition to back to room 304. agent #3 turns a computer around with the tip of his gun, whose screen reads "receiving call / (internet line)".] 
pickle rick:... because this pickle doesn't care about your children. and i'm not gonna take their dreams. i'm gonna take their parents. 
[pickle rick steps on a laptop mouse whose screen reads "sending call". the window which reads that is minimized and another window is pulled up which reads "sending explosion / ...". transition to to room 304. the computer screen now reads "receiving explosion / (internet line)". the laptop blows up and the three agents are sent flying. pickle rick jumps out of an air duct into the hallway where the three agents are, holding a device he constructed. he holds up the device and a laser comes out, which burns a hole through all three of the men's heads, killing them instantly. three more agents come from around the corner. pickle rick reloads the device and shoots another laser, this time chopping off the three other agents' ankles with it. he runs away. transition to to the surveillance room. pickle rick shows up on each of the monitors, and turns them off as he appears on them.] 
agent 2: solen'ya! he's coming! it's because i threw half-way my sandwich! 
agency director: he's just a pickle! 
agent 2: he's a monster! 
agency director: he's not the only one. 
[the agency director straightens his tie. transition to to another door. the agency director uses a key card to open the door, which leads to another metal door with two guards standing next to it. he turns the wheel on the door, opening it. jaguar sits inside.] 
agency director: you can stay, dead to the world and die in this room. or you can kill a pickle for me and earn your freedom. 
jaguar: there is no freedom while your leader breathes. our country is a prison. 
agency director: then katarina is a prisoner. perhaps i could arrange her escape, as well. she lives, jaguar. 
jaguar: where is this pickle? 
[transition to to dr. wong's office.] 
dr wong: what do you think is in the syringe, beth? 
beth: you're the one that costs 200 an hour. you tell me. 
summer: anti-pickle serum. 
morty: it's anti-pickle serum. 
dr wong: your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum. 
beth: my kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases. 
[morty picks up a book which sits on dr. wong's coffee table, which he opens and reads] 
beth: they're just angry at me for divorcing their father. 
summer: i never said i was angry at you. 
beth: that's the point of pottery-enamel huffing, summer. you do it so you don't have to say"i'm angry at mommy"out loud. 
morty: oh, my god! 
[morty closes the book and puts it back on the coffee table, pointing at it] 
morty: oh, there-there's pictures of people eating poop in there! 
[dr. wong picks the book up and puts it on her lap] 
dr wong: it's not my job to take sides or pass judgment. do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him-- 
beth: he won't have to ask for it, okay? he won't need it. he'll just make more. he doesn't need anything from anyone. 
dr wong: you admire him for that. 
beth: it's better than making your problems other people's problems. 
[transition to to pickle rick and jaguar fighting in an office. pickle rick tries to shoot jaguar with his laser while jaguar tries to shoot at pickle rick with two guns. a bullet hits pickle rick and takes a small chunk out of him.] 
pickle rick: oh, come on! 
[pickle rick hits jaguar's shoulder with the laser, pickle rick hides behind a shelf while jaguar hides behind a desk] 
jaguar: pickle man, you should know this isn't personal! 
[jaguar bites a bullet, and pours the gunpowder into a coffee filter] 
pickle rick: you should know that isn't original. 
[pickle rick kicks open a styrofoam container with a burger inside and pulls it towards him] 
jaguar: they have my daughter. 
[jaguar takes a water bottle and pours the water into his open wound] 
jaguar: there's nothing i won't do to see her again. 
pickle rick: yeah, there's lots i wouldn't do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit. 
[pickle rick takes a tomato slice out of the burger and squeezes it onto his missing chunk. he pulls out a packet of mustard and bites it open. jaguar pours the gunpowder into his wound and winces. pickle rick rubs mustard on his missing chunk and shouts, squeezing open the mustard packet. jaguar lights a match and puts it up to the wound, setting it on fire. pickle rick grabs a stapler and staples a pickle slice to his missing chunk. both shout in unison] 
jaguar: i never bullshit, pickle man. this can only end with one of us dead, and i have never died. 
pickle rick: that will be your downfall, jaguar, not being open to new experiences. 
[transition to to surveillance room. the two continue fighting. pickle rick's laser gradually takes out all of the cameras 
agency director: is it done? jaguar?! 
pickle rick: jaguar couldn't make it. 
agency director: do it. okay, you win, pickle man. i'm unsealing the building.
pickle rick: no, thanks. i'm coming for you now.
agency director: pickle man, there's 100 million worth of bonds in a safe on level two. i'll give you the combination.
agent 2: that money belongs to the people. 
agency director: shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick! do we have a deal?! 
pickle rick: take that money, give it to jaguar's daughter when you set her free. or i'll be visiting you. 
agency director: jaguar's daughter is dead. 
pickle rick: huh, so you're a liar. 
agency director: jaguar was an animal. you're an intelligent pickle. we can do business.
pickle rick: i don't think so. see you soon.
agency director: is the helicopter here? 
agent 2: yes. and the police are on the way. what do we tell them?
agency director: tell them we were robbed. hey! hey, what are you doing?! i'm right here! farewell, solen'ya.
jaguar: f-15s are scrambled. this helicopter will be shot down in seven minutes. 
pickle rick: well, my daughter is about five away, and i've got about eight to live. 
jaguar: pickle man, it's too late for me to tell my daughter i love her, but not for you. 
pickle rick: oh, well, uh, she knows. i mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. in fact, i even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants.
jaguar: okay. good luck with that. wait. do i have infinite daughters?
pickle rick: huh? uh, no. no, nope, sorry about that. nope, just me. yeesh!
[transition to to dr. wong's office.] 
beth: i am afraid that my kids will get expelled. 
dr wong: good. summer, you go.
summer: i am mad that i can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. i hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high.
dr wong: good job. morty, do you have an "i" statement? 
morty: i am sad that i peed. i'm sad that i peed in class instead of a toilet. 
dr wong: look at this family go. you guys are pros. what do you guys think about doing this once a week?
pickle rick: ugh. 
[pickle rick walks in and flops on the couch next to summer.] 
dr wong: you must be rick. 
pickle rick: mm-hmm. 
dr wong: i've heard a lot about you today. your family is crazy about you. your daughter holds you in very high regard. you're a lucky fella.
pickle rick: yeah, thank you. uh, sweetie, you don't still happen to have that syringe in your purse?
beth: dad i would like you to tell me what's in the syringe. 
pickle rick: it's a serum that i need to, uh, to stay alive. i have had a rough day. and, uh, i've sustained a lot of damage. i'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent.
dr wong: by changing you from a pickle to a human. 
pickle rick: yes. 
dr wong: rick, why did you lie to your daughter? 
pickle rick: so i wouldn't have to come here. 
dr wong: why didn't you want to come here? 
pickle rick: because i don't respect therapy, because i'm a scientist. because i invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when i don't like something about the world, i change it. and i don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. i think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something i want for myself. i'm not a cow. i'm a pickle when i feel like it. so you asked.
dr wong: rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. you seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. and i think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. you chose to come here, you chose to talk to belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. you are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. i have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way i'm bored when i brush my teeth and wipe my ass. because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. there's no way to do it so wrong you might die. it's just work. and the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people well, some people would rather die. each of us gets to choose. that's our time. i'm going to give you guys my card and hope to hear from you again. and if you have any friends or family that eat poop and would like to stop, give them my number.
[transition to to beth's car.] 
pickle rick: i, um i'm sorry i lied to get out of the thing. i-i shouldn't lie to you.
beth: oh, it's fine. i mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't. but i hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be.
pickle rick: oh, no, i mean, i know it was morty peeing his pants and summer snorting glue or whatever 
beth: she huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it. 
pickle rick: well, there was so much more at stake. i mean, that shrink, what a monologuist. 
summer: are we gonna go back? 
pickle rick: sweetie, could i get get that syringe now? 
beth: oh, my god, yes! dad, it's in my purse. oh, i'm sorry. you must be in agony.
rick: eh. jesus. jesus christ. therapists, man.
beth: weird breed. 
rick: man, i missed having hands and blood and a stomach. we should get a drink.
beth: really? like, go somewhere? 
rick: yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on. 
beth: absolutely. 
morty: i, i liked her. 
beth: so what are you thinking, like, smokey's tavern? maybe shoney's? 
rick: yeah, either one. either one. 
[post credits. transition to to concerto's death trap piano.] 
rick: you'll never get away with this, concerto. 
concerto: that is where you're mistaken, mr. sanchez. this shall be my greatest performance of all time!
rick: this is it, morty. we're goners. we're not getting out of this one. after everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. make peace with your god.
morty: oh, geez, rick, i-i-i don't want to die! 
concerto: and now for the e-splat! 
[jaguar glides in and kills concerto.] 
rick: jaguar! 
morty: who? who was that, rick? 
rick: that, morty, is why you don't go to therapy. 
dramatic music plays tv: cynthia 
jerry: oh, my god, no, no, 
summer: i told you, 
beth: hold on, will you please, not marry me? 
tv: i chose veronica, 
summer: what?! 
jerry: yes! 
beth: called it, 
summer: why would he chose veronica? 
jerry: because he loves her? 
rick: well, if it's any consolation, summer, none of it mattered and the entire show was stupid, 
jerry: okay, i've got an idea, rick, you show us your concept of good tv, and we'll crap all over that, 
rick: thought you'd never ask, 
jerry: hey, 
morty: oh, cool, is that crystallized xanthanite? it conducts electrons across dimensions, rick 20 accurate as usual, morty, the important thing being, i just upgraded our cable package with programing from every conceivable reality, 
jerry: wait, does that mean we get showtime extreme? 
rick: how about showtime extreme in a world where man evolved from corn? 
tv corn 1: we're not so different, we're both corn of action, 
tv: corn 2 yeah, but one of us is dead is dead corn! 
summer: boring 
rick: summer you just spent three months watching a man chose a fake wife, 
jerry: so, what, it'd be better if the people were corn? 
rick: jerry, you don't get it, this is infinite tv from infinite universes, look, 
glen: this shit is delicious, 
rick: a movie about a guy eating shit, a violent antique show, 
letterman: it's a pleasure to have you, 
actor jerry: the pleasure's all mine, rick letterman from a timeline where jerry's famous, 
jerry: wait! 
beth: what in the hell? 
rick: i agree, where is this going? 
jerry: no, the other thing! go back, 
rick: really? all right, fine, 
woman: glen, this is a court order, it says you can't eat shit anymore, 
rick: all right, jerry, when you're right, you're right, now i'm hooked, 
announcer: coming up next on"shmloo's the shmloss,"shmlony has a nightmare, 
shmlony: shmlantha! shmlona! 
rick: amazing--a dimension where all proper nouns begin with"shmla," 
shmlony: shmla--shmlangela? shmlonathan? 
rick: all right, that actually got old pretty quick, 
jerry: rick, will you please go back to me on"david letterman"? 
rick: infinity's a big number, jerry, i don't remember the channel, 
summer: ah! go back! go back! 
rick: geez, actor jerry you speak the true-true, 
summer: oh, my god, dad's in"cloud atlas"! 
jerry: i'm in"cloud atlas"! what's"cloud atlas"? 
actor jerry: sometimes, small true-true different than the big true-true, 
beth: how is this possible? 
rick: infinite timelines, infinite possibilities, including a timeline where jerry's a movie star, look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect to this device, wha--look at this, 
announcer: and now, another quick mystery, 
cop: i just want to know who could have done something like this, it's a travesty, 
gansta: i did, see this knife and all the blood on it? here's my fingerprints, 
judge: guilty, i sentence you to life in prison, 
announcer: here's another quick mystery, 
victim s son: my mother's dead, 
killer: and i killed her, here's the weapon, and cuff me, thank you very much, 
judge: guilty, sentenced to murder, 
[ chokes, gag ] 
announcer: here's another, 
killer: i'm the killer, 
announcer: oh, wow, that one was really quick, wasn't it? 
rick: now, who wants to watch random, crazy tv shows from different dimensions, and--and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate selves? 
jerry: i want to obsess about myself, 
rick:[sighs] here, these scan your retinas and let you view parallel timelines through genetically matching versions of your eyes, go fetch, 
summer: this is so cool, 
beth: ladies first, 
rick: i'm proud of you morty 
morty: hey, man, i don't give a crap about myself, rick, let's watch some crazy stuff, yo, 
ants in my eyes johnson: i'm ants in my eyes johnson, here at ants in my eyes johnson's electronics, i mean, there's so many ants in my eyes, and there's so many tv, microwaves, radios, i think, i can't--i'm not 100 sure what we have here in stock because i can't see anything, our prices, i hope, aren't too low, check out this refrigerator, only 200, what about this microwave? only 100, that's fair, i'm ants in my eyes johnson, everything's black, i can't see a thing, and also, i can't feel anything, either, did i mention that? but that's not as catchy as having ants in your eyes, so that always goes, you know, off by the wayside, i can't feel, it's a very rare disease, all my--all my nerves, they don't allow for the sensation of touch, so i never know what's going on, am i standing, sitting? i don't know, 
beth: are we sure we want to do this--look at our own alternate lives? 
jerry: you're right, maybe we should just play yahtzee, give me those, 
[ beeping ] 
beth: what do you see? 
jerry: whiteness--pure whiteness, 
[ snorting ] 
johnny depp: you're my best friend, jerry smith, i love doing cocaine with you, 
jerry: whoa, i love doing cocaine with you, too, johnny depp, 
beth: haven't we spent enough time on you? i'm performing surgery... but not on a horse--on a human, 
jerry: that's great, beth, you always wanted to be a real surgeon, 
beth: i am a real surgeon, 
jerry: uh... summer's turn, 
summer: finally, 
[ beeping ] 
summer: i don't see anything, 
beth: well, you should select a different timeline, i mean, if your father and i achieved our dreams, there's a chance you weren't even born, that came out wrong, that came out very wrong, 
summer: fine, i'll find a world where you bothered to have me, 
[ beeping ] 
summer: we're playing yahtzee, 
beth: yahtzee's fun, we love yahtzee, 
jerry: it's a fun game for fun families, hey, could i get those goggles back? 
commercial voiceover: it's a 45-horsepower with antilock brakes, and it's the official car of"mr, sneezy 3d,"it's the brand-new sneezy xl, the horn, when you honk it, makes a sneeze noise, it's polite, it's right, and it's sneezy, deezy mc... deluxe, 
mr sneezy: i'm mr, sneezy, 
morty: huh, seems like tv from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it, 
rick: yeah, it's got an almost improvisational tone, 
trailer announcer: it's in theaters now, coming this summer, two brothers in a van, and then a meteor hits, and they ran as fast as they could from giant cat monsters, and then a giant tornado came, and that's when things got knocked into 12th gear, a mexican armada shows up, with weapons made from t-tomatoes, and you better bet your bottom dollar that these two brothers know how to handle business in"alien invasion tomato monster"mexican armada brothers, who are just regular brothers, running in a van from an asteroid and all sort of things the movie,"hold on, there's more, old women are coming, and they're also in the movie, and they're gonna come and cross attack these two brothers, but let's get back to the brothers, because they're--they have a strong bond, you don't want to know about it here, but i'll tell you one thing, the moon--it comes crashing into earth, and what do you do then? it's two brother and--and they're gonna--it's called"two brothers,""two brothers,"it's just called"two brothers," 
beth: holy crap, i am winning a nobel prize, 
jerry: come on, time's up, i'm taming a lion, no, wait, there are film cameras, i might be a lion tamer in a movie, you get the idea, i work with lions, 
[ beeping ] 
summer: ohh, we're not playing yahtzee, we're playing chutes and ladders, seems like when i exist, life gets a little more--i don't know--predictable? 
beth: when two people create a life together, they set aside their previous lives as individuals, 
jerry: give me a break, we're not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night, 
beth: oh, i get it, now that you know you could have had it better, you resent me for holding you back, 
jerry: well, now that we know you think the tables are turning, we know you thought there were unturned tables, 
beth: what are you talking about? 
jerry: all this time, you've been thinking,"what if that loser, jerry, hadn't talked me out of the abortion?"well, now you know you'd be a doctor, whoop-de-do, you'd also be drinking wine alone in a house full of exotic birds, and i'd be on dicaprio's yacht, banging kristen stewart, 
summer: you thought about getting an abortion? 
beth: everyone thinks about it, obviously, i'm the version of me that didn't do it, so you're welcome, 
jerry: yeah, you're welcome, 
summer: yeah, thank you guys so much, it's a real treat to be raised by parents that forced themselves to be together instead of being happy, 
rick: hey, do we have any wafer cookies? mmm! oh, boy, looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh? that's too bad, you know, me and morty are having a blast, we just discovered a show called"ball fondlers,"i mean, i don't want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse, 
rick: i'm in heaven right now, 
morty: this might be the best day of my life, 
beth: so, now what do we do? 
jerry: that show"ball fondlers"sounded kind of interesting, 
summer: dad! 
jerry: what?! they're having fun in there, what do you guys want from me? every family on this block has to wonder if they're together by choice, our family just has interdimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we're not, 
summer: well, i'm leaving, 
beth: you can't leave, you're 17, 
summer: yeah, and i'm not pregnant, i'm gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age, i'm gonna move to the southwest and... i don't know, do something with turquoise, 
snl announcer: it's"saturday night live,"starring a piece of toast, two guys with handlebar mustaches, a man painted silver who makes robot noises, gar ma nar nar, three, um, um, um, i'll get back to that one, a hole in the wall where the men can see it all, and returning for his 25th consecutive year, bobby moynihan! 
rick: interesting fun fact--moynihan and a piece of toast hate each other, apparently, they've got some real creative differences, 
fakedoor salesman: hey, are you tired of real doors cluttering up your house, where you open them and you actually go somewhere, and you go into another room? get on down to real fake doors, that's us, fill a whole room up with them, see, watch, check this out, won't open, won't open, not this one, not this one, none of them open, fakedoors, com is our website, so check it out for a lot of really great deals on fake do-o-o-o-rs! 
morty: hey, wait a minute, rick, i thought this was a commercial, what's going on?

fakedoor salesman: step on it! we all get places to be! son of a bitch, 
morty: oh, that must be where he lives, okay, 
rick: huh, he's making himself a sandwich now, 
fakedoor salesman: hey, everybody, so, this is my house, just made a sandwich--peanut butter and jelly, still here, still selling fake doors, 
morty: what? 
rick: oh, my god, it's still the commercial, 
fakedoor salesman: we have fake doors like you wouldn't believe, what are you worried about? come get fake doors, call us up and order some fake doors today, don't even hesitate, don't even worry,-and don't even--rick all right, i'm bored, change it,

fakedoor salesman: that's our slogan, see it on the bottom of the screen below our name, here's another slogan right below that one, what are you worried about? come get fake doors, get in here quick, get out quicker with an arm of fake doors in your arms, 
morty: okay, okay, you can change it, 
fakedoor salesman: don't even worry about it, 
[ yawn ] 
gazorpazorpfield: i hate mamumanums-days, and i really could go for some enchiladas, morty hey, rick, that's pretty cool, it's just like garfield, only instead it's gazorpazorpfield, 
rick: hey, isn't gazorpazorp where--where those sex robots came from? remember that whole thing? 
morty: yeah, hey, that's a pretty--pretty--that's true, that's right, 
rick: yeah, let's watch some more gazorpazorpfield, 
gazorpazorpfield: hey, john, it's me, gazorpazorpfield, boy[bleep] you, john, you[bleep] dumb, stupid idiot, 
john: come on, gazorpazorpfield, go easy on me, huh? 
gazorpazorpfield: you dumb, stupid, weak, pathetic, white, white, uh... guilt--white-guilt milquetoast piece of human garbage, 
john: geez, gazorpazorpfield, that's--you know, you're pretty mean to me, but that takes the cake, 
gazorpazorpfield: i don't give a[bleep] i'm gazorpazorp[bleep] field, bitch, now give me my[bleep] enchiladas, 
morty: hey, rick, you know, did they use bill murray for this? sounds a lot like bill murray, 
rick: no, morty, it's lorenzo music, in this reality, he's still alive, 
morty: oh, okay, was his name"lorenzo music"? 
rick: yeah, i'm pretty sure, he also did the voice of that one guy from"ghostbusters,"which is really strange because it's the same character bill murray played in the movie, but then, when they made the movie, bill murray did the voice of gazorpazorp--or garfield, i mean, 
morty: yeah, that's pretty cool, rick, so all that happened in this reality, too? 
rick: i don't know, just making conversation with you, morty, what, you think i'm a--i'm--i know everything about everything? 
beth: did you really talk me out of the abortion? 
jerry: well, we--we blew a tire on the way to the clinic, 
beth: i think, in my head, i was doing it all for the kids, and now the first kid is going to do something with turquoise, 
jerry: which is either code for crystal meth or a gateway to it, 
beth: so we didn't do the kids any favors, so we should stay together for each other and ourselves or... 
jerry: or... 
political ad: man, woman, and now trunkman? we know science has created men that have a trunk that allows them to have sex with both male and female partners, but we don't like the idea of these people getting married, put a line in the sand, everybody, vote"no"on proposition xw2, the act that says trunk people can get married, who needs it? not on my watch, paid for by michael denny and the denny singers, 
trunkperson: hi, i'm a trunkperson, and i want--i feel love in my heart, too, just like you, i want to be able to express that love with both a man and a woman, and i won't be able to if denny and the denny singers get their way, hey, let the trunkpeople have sex and get married, huh? paid for by trunkpeople, 
mr tophat jones: oh, i love me strawberry sniggles, ooh, i hope nobody ever gets my hands on me and tries to steal my strawberry smiggles, i'm gonna eat every last one of them, because--and then they'll be in my stomach, and nobody will ever be able to eat them, except for me, because they're gonna be all inside my stomach, um, my name is mr, tophat jones, and god forbid anyone ever take my sner--little-people snibbles, i'm keeping them all for me, mmm, mmm, last bite, oh, now they're all resting comfortably in my stomach, ooh, am i feeling good, no! get away from me! get away from me! there's no more strawberry snibbles--no![chokes, sputt] jesus christ! jesus christ! it hurts! my entrails are out! why would you even want to eat these? they're soaked with my stomach acid, oh, jesus christ, lord, savior, and spirit, save me, take me to the light, oh, my god, i see demons, i see demons are coming! 
morty: geez, rick, oh, my god, that's some pretty hard-core stuff, you know, for a cereal commercial, 
rick: well, you know, morty i mean, you want to sell boxes of cereal, you got to pump the gas a little, pedal to the metal, morty, 
trailer announcer: in a world where muscular mannies are coming, and they're coming strong, there's only three unmuscular michaels, get down, hurry, run,[screeching] and that's when real turbulent juice is coming, and you got to take care of it, with turbulent juice, turbulent tables, no room is safe from the turbulent power of turbulent juice, 
morty: what in the hell? 
rick: sex sells, morty, 
morty: sex sells what? was that a movie or, like, does it clean stuff? 
jerry:[sighs] 
morty: hey, dad, 
jerry: god, 
morty: what's going on? 
jerry: well, your mother and i are gonna be spending some time apart, morty, and your sister found out she was an unwanted pregnancy, 
morty: what? 
rick: speaking of what, morty what should we watch next? what about this? detective babylegs, you're a good detective, but not good enough, because of your baby legs, so i'm partnering you up with regular legs,

[transition to blips and chitz] 
rick: aw, this place is the best. it s got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is.

morty: i m morty you re rick hey, you sold a gun to a guy that kills people! 
rick: lookit this. you beat cancer and then you went back to work at the carpet store? boo. 
(rick sits in the seat to play roy.) 
morty: don t dodge the issue, rick! selling a gun to a hitman is the same as pulling the trigger! 
rick: it s also the same as doing nothing. if krombopulos michael wants someone dead, there s not a lot anybody can do to stop him. that s why he does it for a living? now if you ll excuse me, it s time to thrash your roy score. puts on the helmet 
morty: you could stop this killing from happening, rick! you know, y-you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted! 
rick: uh-huh, yeah, that s the difference between you and me, morty. i never go back to the carpet store.

krombopulos michael: oh boy, here i go killin again! 
(krombopulos michael sneaks through the building, killing several gromflomite guards along the way before arriving in the chamber his target is kept. his target appears to be a strange, gaseous being. krombopulos michael draws his weapon, but before he can shoot, morty crashes rick’s ship through the ceiling, crushing him.) 
ship: you have arrived at krombopulos michael. your destination is below. 
morty: dazed all out of off-white persians gets out of the ship and realizes he killed krombopulos michael oh man, wha-wh-wh-what have i done?! picks up km s arm and the antimatter gun 
gromflomite: (pointing a gun at morty) drop the gun! 
morty: you don t understand! this guy was gonna kill someone! 
gromflomite: i guess that makes two of us. fires up his weapon 
(a portal forms through the guard, bisecting him down the middle, and rick walks out of it.) 
rick: what are you doing morty?! this is a galactic federation outpost! look, i don t have time to tell you my entire backstory, but grandpa and government don t get along! 
fart: you saved my life! 
(rick and morty both turn to face the gaseous being.)

fart: i like this name, fart. morty, would you kindly release me by pulling that lever to the left of my cell? i am in great pain. 
rick: morty, don t do it. (morty walks toward the lever.) morty (morty glances at rick before pulling the lever. alarms start to sound as fart escapes his cell.) morty, you idiot! 
morty: oh crap, let s get you outta here! 
rick: we can t get him outta here. he s gaseous. he s not gonna make it through a portal, morty. 
morty: stomps past rick well then i guess we re all getting in the car! right, uh 
fart: fart. 
morty: no! jus-j-j-just get in the car! 
(fart floats into the car and morty sits in the driver’s seat.) 
rick: morty, come on, i-i wanna go back to blips and chitz. i don t wanna deal with this! 
morty: y-you ve been clear on the fact that you don t wanna help, so just go away! 
fart: more are coming. 
(rick starts walking off.) 
rick: screw this. i m out. 
(rick forms a portal and leaves through it. morty tries to start the car as a gromflomite approaches, but it stalls.) 
morty: oooh ! come on, come on! 
gromflomite: get out of the vehicle made of garbage or we will open fire! 
morty: still trying to start the car oh no no no! 
gromflomite: open fire! 
(a portal appears directly above the guards and water pours out of it, flooding the room. another portal appears on the floor, and the water and gromflomites are sucked into it. a third portal then appears and rick emerges through it, walking up to the car.) 
rick: stupid-ass fart-saving carpet-store motherfucker! shoves morty out of the driver s seat and takes the wheel move! 
(fart moves to the backseat as morty takes the passenger seat.) 
rick: wait, did you fuck with my seat settings? 
(morty buckles up and rick begins adjusting the seat settings.) 
fart: more are coming. 
(more gromflomites storm into the room. rick continues adjusting the seat.) 
morty: rick! 
rick: yeah, yeah. (he crashes the car into the gromflomites before flying away from the outpost.) 
[transition to gear world, int. gearhead’s shop/residence] 
(rick, morty, and fart wait while gearhead works on the car. morty and fart are watching gazorpazorpfield.) 
gearhead: your geldon convertor is pretty dinged up. 
rick: that s cause my grandson drives like a male obavradian. yeah, i said it. some stereotypes are based in fact. 
gearhead: actually, it s because of years of neglect. you really need to respect your gears, rick. to you, they re just wheels with teeth, but in my culture, wars have been fought, entire 
rick: interrupts him so i ve heard. just fix it. to morty i don t think the gromflomites can track us now, but it looks like we re gonna be here for awhile. lowers voice or, ya know, if you still have that gun k. michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home. 
fart: you do understand i m telepathic, right? 
rick: i m being polite. 
morty: rick, we re taking him back where he belongs! 
rick: yeah, where s that? are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it? 
fart: i came here accidentally through a wormhole located in what you call get out of my head, fart, i know you re in here, la la la la no, in what you call the promethean nebula. 
rick: oh great, just a hop, skip, and an 800 lightyear jump! 
morty: you know, you can leave any time you want, rick. 
rick: walks away, muttering whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch 
fart: thank you, morty. you are not like other carbon-based life forms. you put the value of all life above your own. 
morty: that s how things should be. it s how they could be. 
fart: i could not agree more. 
(fart envelops morty as “goodbye moonmen” begins.) 
fart: (singing over a montage formed from morty s imagination) the world can be one together cosmos without hatred stars like diamonds in your eyes. the ground can be space (space, space, space, space) with feet marching toward a peaceful sky. all the moonmen want things their way but we make sure they see the sun. goodbye, moonmen you say goodbye, moonmen. goodby

jerry: uuuum 
[transition to gearhead’s place] 
(gearhead continues working on the car while the others watch ball fondlers. the show is cut off by breaking news.) 
gear anchor: no gear turnings as of yet in the curious case of these unidentified humanoid fugitives (an image of rick and morty in the car as rick was adjusting the seat settings appears onscreen.) reportedly at large somewhere within the gear system. 
rick: son of a approaches fart why were the gromflomites holding you prisoner? what the fuck is so valuable about you? 
fart: i am no more valuable than life itself. however, i am able to alter the composition of atoms, like this. (an electric fuzz seems to go through the gaseous cloud and a lump of gold materializes, dropping to the ground beneath him.) that was oxygen. i added seventy-one protons to it. 
rick: picks up the gold ah, terrific. the fart that pooped gold. no wonder every cop in the system is lookin for us! pockets gold any species that gets a hold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. do you know how inconvenient that s gonna be to my work? 
(sirens sound outside. rick rushes to the window and sees police in flying vehicles have surrounded the place.) 
rick: somebody dropped the dime on us. gearhead turns around 
gearhead: pointing a gun at rick i m sorry, rick. the reward on your head is too high. and like you always say, you gotta look out for number one. 
rick: number one is me, asshole! you re supposed to be my friend! 
gearhead: friend? do you even know my real name? it s revolio clockberg junior. i belong to an entire species of gear people. calling me gearhead is like calling a chinese person asia-face. 
(rick notices a nearby box of twigs, marked with a warning. he throws them at gearhead and they get caught in his mouth, causing him to drop the gun.) 
gearhead: no, not twigs! 
(rick kicks gearhead in the crotch, removes his gear-testicles, pulls two gears out of his mouth, and shoves the gear-testicles in their place while gearhead moans in pain, clutching his mouth and groin.) 
rick: two things i wanna make clear to everybody in this room. never betray me, and it s time to go. 
(rick, morty, and fart get in the car and fly out through a window. two gear police enter.) 
gear policeman 1: nobody move! 
(gearhead waves his hands, trying to communicate. the officers see how he’s been disfigured.) 
gear policeman 2: oh my god. 
gear policeman 1: are those ? 
(both vomit oil and metal.) 
[transition to ext. gear world] 
(rick leads police on a flying chase, shooting and driving at the same time. numerous police cars crash, killing officers and civilians.) 
rick: hey morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? how do you feel about all these people getting killed because of your choices? 
morty: i did the right thing, rick! 
rick: tell that to gearhead s gearsticles. 
morty: you did that! 
rick: wrong! i d be playin roy right now. at a certain point, my hands are tied, morty. 
(both don expressions of surprise as helicopters appear in front of them. rick quickly steers the craft away and the chase continues.) 
[transition to forgotten jerrys room] 
jerry: playing poker with other jerrys, sighs i can t believe rick did this. this is the eighth to the last straw. 
bearded jerry: ante up. 
jerry: you know what? throws down cards screw it! i have a better gamble for your guys. leans forward i say we escape. 
(other jerrys stare at him for several seconds.) 
bearded jerry: if you want to leave, you can just go out the front door. 
tank-top jerry: you think we re kept here against our will? that would be illegal. 
jerry: but if you can leave, then why are you still here? 
buzzcut jerry: same reason as you. looks to other jerrys for confirmation we re jerrys. 
(jerry stands in disgust.) 
[transition to jerryboree lobby] 
(jerry is marching out.) 
jerry: i m leaving. 
jerry-sitter: okay then, that was always allowed. 
[transition to gearworld] 
(the chase is still on. rick stops his vehicle, and gromflomite ships pass him, giving him a chance to shoot them. he drives off again and pulls out a gun.) 
rick: morty, take the wheel! 
(rick and morty clumsily swap seats.) 
morty: whoa, whoa! 
rick: whoa! 
(rick climbs into his seat as morty buckles up.) 
rick: geez, dammit, morty! who taught you to fly this thing?! laughs haha, i m kidding, i know that s on me. 
morty: um, rick! 
(an enormous craft lowers down before them. at this point, the car is surrounded.) 
rick: shit. well, i guess this is it. 
fart: morty, crack the window. 
(morty open the window and fart flies out, entering a gear policecar and entering the officer’s mind.) 
fart: i wonder why greg is always so critical of my girlfriend. 
officer: well he d probably like to have me to himself, that s how friends are. 
fart: or does he want her to himself? 
(fart induces an image in the officer’s mind of greg having sex with his girlfriend. “goodbye moonmen” begins again.) 
fart: the world can be one together cosmos without hatred stars like diamonds in your eyes. 
officer: anguished my life is a fucking joke. 
(he crashes his cruiser, setting off a chain of destruction of police and government vehicles as fart continues singing. rick and morty look on from the car, shocked.) 
fart: goodbye, moonmen. you say, goodbye, moonmen. 
(the destruction beings to kill civilians of gearworld.) 
fart: goodbye, moonmen (fart floats back in through the window and the song ends.) alright, let s proceed. 
rick: damn. can t blame that on the dog. talk about silent but deadly. i-i ve seen some nerve gas but ga-th-this gas got some nerve! haha, you know what i m sayin ? 
morty: not amused are you done? 
rick: i ll let you know, morty. gone with the wind, am i right? if you don t like that one, morty, an alt on that one could be, like if i said gasablanca! alright, i m done. (morty starts driving.) let s get to the promethean nebula, so my grandson can finish savin a life!

(jerry walks through a set of sliding doors and gets in line, intent on finding a way back home. he approaches the window.) 
garblovian: ga-ga blahg blahg? 
jerry: um earth, please? 
(the alien stamps a ticket and passes it to jerry.) 
jerry: um is this do i pay? 
garblovian: agah blahg-blah! (jibberish continues as jerry rushes away. other aliens heckle him.) 
jerry: sorry! 
[transition to ext. cross-temporal asteroid] 
(jerry passes a homeless alien holding a sign that says “why lie? will use glems for gloobies!” he then spots a creature that appears somewhat like a small hairless dog.) 
jerry: hmm. hmm hesitantly makes to pet the creature, but its face suddenly splays out in a tentacle formation agh! runs away 
(jerry runs into an alleyway where he’s met by a shirtless garblovian, holding out a cup.) 
garblovian: agah blahg blahg? 
jerry: i don t 
garblovian: angrily agah blahg! 
jerry: what do you want? 
garblovian: holds out cup agah blahg blah 
(the alien suddenly explodes into bluish goo. some of it gets on jerry.) 
jerry: oh! looks at self and begins panicking ahahaaaahhhhh . 
(two smaller garblovians run up to jerry, jabbering and holding out cups. jerry runs away, and one drinks some of the bluish goo from its cup.) 
jerry: wiping goo off himself uhhh huhhh . (stumbles upon two fleshy alien creatures mid-coitus.) oooh! runs away 
(jerry now sits on a lone bench under a streetlight, looking around the alien world in obvious fear and flinching at strange noises.) 
[transition to int. jerryboree] 
(jerry walks back inside, hanging his head. the jerry-sitter smiles cheerfully. he approaches some of the same jerrys from before. they’re trying to set up a television.) 
tank-top jerry: hey, are you the one that left? 
jerry: single nod 
tank-top jerry: i get it. it s uh a hassle out there. 
jerry: suddenly less forlorn right? who needs that? 
other jerrys: to one another right? not me. 
paul: oh-ho, not us! 
jerry: uh who are you? 
paul: oh, excuse me. paul fleishman. shakes jerry s hand infinite timelines! in some of them beth remarries. 
jerry: geez 
paul: don t worry. i treat beth very well, and i do not overstep my bounds with morty. every kid needs a dad, but there s no replacing you. hey, you wanna give us a hand with this? gestures to the tv we re trying to figure out how to get the sound coming through the stereo instead of the tv. i-i-i don t it s very difficult. 
jerry: oh. uh, well, is there an aux input? 
tank-top jerry: i tried that, but there s two different colors. 
(pans out to show several clusters of jerrys also working on identical television sets.) 
various jerrys: uh there s two different colors. 
[transition to promethean nebula] 
(dinosaur-like creatures eat plant matter in what appears to be a vast jungle. rick’s ship flies into view. rick is now behind the wheel.) 
fart: the wormhole is seventy of what you call meters what you call north of what you call here. 
rick: fine. morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes. i m gonna find some fuel and take a biiiig fat morty. (morty gets out of the car.) that s my new word for shit because of today s events. 
(morty and fart head north, soon finding the wormhole.) 
fart: here it is. this should take me back to my kind. 
morty: i m gonna miss you, um, fart. i m really sorry your name became fart. 
fart: i will be back soon, morty. 
morty: excited really? 
fart: after i return to the others with this location, we will be back for your cleansing. 
morty: um cleansing ? 
fart: carbon-based life is a threat to all higher life. to us, you are what you would call a disease. wherever we discover you, we cure it. you said yourself that life must be protected even through sacrifice. (morty, shocked and saddened, begins to tear up.) you haven t changed your mind about that. i can sense your thoughts. morty. 
morty: wipes his eyes um before you go could you sing a c-could you sing for me again? 
fart: yes, morty. approaches him as goodbye moonmen begins, again set to a sequence formed from morty s imagination cosmos without hatred blinding stars of cosmic light quasars shine through endless night and everything is one in the beauty and now we say goodby 
(the song is interrupted as morty shoots fart with the antimatter gun.) 
fart: morty why why? 
(morty shoots him several more times until he completely vanishes, then drops the gun, crying.) 
morty: goodbye. 
(rick is loading something into the ship as morty returns.) 
rick: so did you guys make out a little bit? is he gonna send you a postcard? (morty wordlessly enters the car.) man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you. 
[transition to open space] 
rick: morty, i know i picked on your core beliefs and decision making a lot today, but i am glad you insisted on gettin that fart home. you know, at least all the death and destruction wasn t for nothin , you know? notices morty s detached, almost anguished expression you miss your fart friend, huh? well i ve got a little surprise for you, buddy. while you were gone i found another wormhole with millions of beings just like him on the other side and they re all coming to visit. 
morty: panicking what?! rick! no, you can t! 
rick: too late, morty. the hole s opening. 
morty: no, no, rick! you don t understand! 
(rick farts.) 
rick: th-there s a lot more where that came from too. 
[transition to jerryboree] 
(our rick and morty enter the lobby, which is filled with ricks, mortys, and jerrys.) 
rick: hey. taps another rick s arm hey bro. how many people was your roy responsible for killing today? 
other rick: none, we chilled at blips and chitz all day, ain t that right homie? 
other morty: darn right bro! roy rules! 
other rick: haha! 
(the other rick and morty leave with their jerry.) 
rick: glares at morty must be nice hey, morty, there s our jerry. 
(the jerry-sitter guides a jerry toward them. he and morty hug.) 
jerry: mm, i missed you. hey, rick. 
rick: glad you re safe jerry. what do you say we go home? 
jerry: i d like that. 
another rick: holding a ticket hey, wait, do you have 5126? 
rick: uh, i m not sure. morty. 
(morty pulls a ticket out of his pocket.) 
other rick: uh, that s a blips and chitz ticket. 
morty: what?! 
rick: way to go, morty. eh, whatever. 
(the ricks exchange jerrys. both jerrys look uncertain and nervous.) 
jerrys: uh w-wait, what? 
ricks: alright, come on, jerry. 
[end credits] 
[transition to alien planet] 
(various species of aliens are walking down the street when they stop and listen to an announcer’s voice.) 
announcer: are you tired of the same daily droll? well, get on over to blips and chitz! (as he describes things, they appear on screen.) we got, uh one game! we got a whole bunch of games here! uh, we got chabos and flobos and you can shoot things! get on over here and play the games! use your flurbos to get tickets! roy 2 just got here! g-get over here at ch chips and chitz!

[end] 
[open ext. smith residence] 
(outside, there is snow on the ground. the smith house is decorated for christmas, and jerry can be heard singing last king christmas.) 
jerry: singing last king christmas last arrived! 
[trans int. kitchen] 
(the kitchen is a mess of food in various stages of preparation. jerry pulls a ham out of the oven as he sings.) 
jerry: singing in the christmas christmas! stops singing and smells the ham mmm jerry, you are really giving it to this ham. 
(jerry enters the living room, where a tree stands with presents underneath it. beth and morty are occupied on tablets while summer uses her smartphone.) 
jerry: um, merry christmas? puts his hands on his hips helloooo? my parents are coming over for the first time in years! can we stow the gadgets and look alive? 
beth: alive? for your parents? 
(jerry snags her tablet away and stows it in a stocking.) 
jerry: good one. 
beth: hey man! 
jerry: you hey man ! this holiday is about humanity. 
morty: not looking up from his tablet you know, i thought it was about being born half-god or something. 
jerry: okay, whatever. all electronic items are going in the stocking. now. 
morty: hands over his tablet ohhhh 
summer: dad, i m not giving you my phone. 
jerry: put it in the stocking, summer, or i m joining facebook. 
(summer gasps and drops her phone in the stocking.) 
rick: offscreen ho ho ho, everybody. 
(rick and ruben enter the house and jerry approaches them.) 
jerry: more like whoa whoa whoa. what is this? my parents are coming! 
rick: calm down jerry, this is ruben, an old friend. 
ruben: pearl harbor. 
rick: i check in on him once a year and give him a little burp medical burp evaluation. 
beth: aw, dad that is so sweet. 
jerry: squinting suspiciously yeah, it is i don t get it. 
ruben: korea. 
rick: don t worry about your c-c-christmas, jerry. leads ruben away ruben and i ll be in my workshop while you have another day in phil collins proverbial paradise. 
(rick and ruben head out to the garage.) 
jerry: huh. you think you know a guy. (the doorbell rings.) okay, there s my parents. now remember, no tv, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this christmas, like old-school jews on a saturday. opens the door hey hey! 
(leonard and joyce walk in.) 
leonard: merry christmas, son. 
(jerry, not noticing jacob, almost closes the door on him, then opens it back up.) 
jerry: oh, hi. can i help you? 
joyce: jerry, this is jacob. takes jacob by the arm didn t you get our text message? 
beth summer and morty: no. 
jacob: you must be jerry! that s a fine lookin apron. william sonoma? 
jerry: smiling uncomfortably i wish but thank you. closes the door so you re a friend of the family ? 
leonard: puts an arm around jacob s shoulders the way we see it, he s a part of the family. 
jerry: wow! 
joyce: after your father s brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and wondered how have we spent it? and how do we spend the rest of it? what are we going to be when we die? a list of fears and questions, or a collection of real experiences? 
beth: holy crap, joyce. that s amazing. 
leonard: then jacob came into our lives. we re learning to live again. 
(jacob puts his arms around joyce and leonard.) 
jacob: all three of us. 
(joyce, leonard, and jacob giggle. jerry stares at them, confused and uncomfortable.) 
jerry: cool eggnog? 
jacob: now we are talkin ! this man s got the apron and the eggnog, huh? 
(all laugh. rick enters and starts laughing with the rest.) 
rick: hi joyce, leonard. looks at jacob hello there. 
jacob: merry christmas, man. 
rick: morty! a moment of your time? 
[transition to rick’s garage] 
(ruben is in fits, laid out on a ping-pong table. he’s naked besides a towel over his genitals and his santa hat.) 
rick: he s in bad shape, morty. 
morty: aw geez, rick! what did you do? 
rick: gee, thanks morty. what kind of monster do you think i am? i-i m sittin here trying to save the guy s life! (rick straps a pack with a tube onto morty s back and puts an earpiece on his head.) i want you to find dr. xenon bloom. he ll know what s goin on. 
morty: extremely nervous uh w-w-where do i find dr. bloom? 
rick: in ruben. shoves a glass oxygen mask onto morty s head 
morty: ruben minnesota? 
rick: ruben on the table, morty! hooks up the backpack to the helmet look, i-i don t have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. pulls a shrink ray into view and plugs it in hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse. 
(rick sets morty under the shrink ray.) 
morty: w-what proc 
(rick activates the shrink ray and morty shrieks as he’s shrunk down to a microscopic size. rick picks up the container morty shrank into and puts it into a syringe, which he stabs into ruben’s chest. just then, beth enters the garage.) 
beth: hey dad, where s morty? 
rick: he s busy. 
[transition to int. ruben’s body] 
(morty continues screaming as he is injected into the body in a stream of pink fluid. he lands on something soft and abruptly stops shouting.) 
rick through morty s earpiece: morty, can you hear me? head north! 
morty: rick where am i? 
[transition to garage] 
rick: adjusts his own headset as he stands in the garage depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance. 
morty through rick s earpiece: the entrance to what? 
rick: welcome, morty. (the scene cuts back to morty s view from inside ruben.) welcome (morty gasps.) to anatomy park! 
(the view pans to show an amusement park with a large anatomy park sign and various attractions and exhibits.) 
rick: it s a little business venture i ve been cookin up on the side with dr. bloom. (morty enters the park.) an amusement park inside a human body. science isn t cheap, morty. this should really help put a dent in the overhead. 
morty: oh my god! this is insane! spleen mountain? bladder falls? pirates of the pancreas? 
rick: you got a problem with that last one, morty? 
morty: huh? no, no, i m just reading them out loud in the order i m seeing them. 
rick: okay, alright, if i sounded a little defensive, it s because pirates of the pancreas was my baby. 
[transition to garage] 
rick: i-i got a lot of push-back when i pitched it, morty. i guess i m still a little defensive. let s just find dr. bloom, alright? i-i m picking up a distress signal in the liver, morty. 
[transition to anatomy park.] 
rick: proceed to the liver. 
(following a sign posting directions, morty hurries off in the direction of the ‘haunted liver,’ taking a shuttle to ‘lower abdomenland’.) 
automated voice: arriving at liver . 
morty: stumbles forward and hits his helmet on the window ow! 
automated voice: mind the gap. 
(morty exits the train and enters a dark, unkempt area with flickering lights.) 
morty: it s really scary in here, rick. 
rick: liver s under maintenance. ruben s seen some rough years, morty. don t judge. you don t agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life s going great. 
[transition to int. haunted liver] 
(morty enters a haunted house-style attraction. an animatronic wolf suddenly springs up behind him.) 
morty: oooohhh! rick, it s a monster! 
rick: no no, morty. the only monster here is alco belch holism. (the wolf is mechanically pulled back into the wall.) that is an animatronic werewolf. 
(a hand reaches from around the corner and a large, muscular man with a thick accent grips morty by the throat, lifting him up and pinning him to the wall with his forearm.) 
poncho: who are you? answer me! where did you come from? 
morty: mmm! m-m-my-my-my grandpa rick sent me! 
dr bloom: poncho! that s quite enough. 
(dr. bloom walks into the room. he appears to be a blob of goo in a roughly human shape with glasses and a walking cane. poncho glares, then reluctantly lets morty fall to the ground.) 
dr bloom: morty, that s poncho. (another man and a girl walk into the room.) this is roger and annie. 
morty: staring sheepishly at annie oh 
dr bloom: and i am dr. xenon bloom. 
(a speaker apparatus emerges from morty’s helmet. rick speaks through it.) 
rick: hey bloom, it s rick. what the hell s goin on here? 
dr bloom: i don t know why, but the entire security system has shut down. and i m afraid the exhibits are unlocked. 
(rick’s speaker retreats into morty’s helmet.) 
morty: exhibits? 
[transition to ext. haunted liver] 
dr bloom: anatomy park s greatest attraction, young man, isn t the music or the food or the pirates of the pancreas. 
rick: watch it. 
dr bloom: it is first and foremost a living museum of humanity s most noble and ferocious diseases. 
morty: diseases?! 
(there’s a distant roaring noise.) 
poncho: hey doc, i have news for ya. (hepatitis a lumbers towards the group.) your living museum is officially a wild safari! 
(poncho begins shooting at hepatitis a.) 
roger: hepatitis a! run! 
(the entire group screams and flees.) 
[transition to dining room] 
(the smith family, sans rick and morty, are seated for dinner with joyce, leonard, and jacob.) 
jacob: oh leans over and wipes some food from joyce s mouth with a napkin the food goes in your mouth, girl! 
(all laugh, but jerry’s laugh is forced.) 
jerry: aha i m sorry jacob, i guess i m still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. are you like a are you like their caretaker? is that what it is? 
joyce: we can go into detail later, son. 
leonard: now wait, there, there s no point to secrecy. let s all live and die honestly. your mother and i have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul. (jerry and jacob smile at each other, but when jacob looks away, jerry s smile becomes a glare.) and when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when eternity is at the door, it s an invitation to let go of the body, and an opportunity to share and experiment. 
jerry: dad, please, what are you saying? 
beth: whatever it is, it s beautiful leonard. glares at jerry and we support you. 
jerry: speak for yourself! because it, heheh, it sounds like you re about to say jacob is your lover. 
leonard: no no no no no no. (jerry sighs in relief.) jacob is your mother s lover. (jerry again looks disturbed.) i watch them. sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a closet. almost always dressed as superman. 
(joyce kisses leonard’s cheek and the two hold hands, looking at each other fondly.) 
jacob: oh reaches across the table and puts a hand atop theirs 
(summer and beth smile. jerry stares, at a loss for words.) 
jacob: jerry, this ham s got to be all you, right? it s in-cred-i-ble. 
summer: smirks happy human holiday, dad. 
(jerry appears more despondent than ever.) 
[transition to anatomy park] 
(poncho continues shooting at hepatitis a.) 
poncho: ahhhhhh! 
(the whole group rushes through a door before entering a code and shutting it.) 
dr bloom: hepatitis won t follow us into the respiratory system! 
(they enter to a set of doors under a sign reading ‘alveoli forest’. roger examines a meter near the door.) 
roger: that s strange taps the meter air flow is down twenty percent. 
dr bloom: so the brain isn t getting enough oxygen. that s why security is offline. 
morty: w-well, i guess we better check it out. 
(the group passes through the doors. as the doors are closing, alexander, dressed in a dog mascot costume, rushes up and passes through.) 
alexander: hey, wait for me! removes the head of his costume 
dr bloom: points his cane at alexander put that back on! 
(alexander pauses a moment before putting the dog head back on. the whole group examines the area.) 
roger: if we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for blockage. 
morty: raises his hand i ll go. glances at annie heheh 
(morty jumps onto one of the bouncy, round alveoli and clings to it.) 
poncho: don t be a hero, kid. 
morty: i m not. i m doin it because it s fun. he hops from frond to frond 
poncho: cocks his gun we shouldn t be here. 
dr bloom: whatever you do, don t fire that thing in here! we must save ruben. this is my life s work. 
(annie touches a growth of bacteria on some tar, which squelches, causing her to gasp in fear and recoil.) 
annie: ah! 
dr bloom: it s alright, my dear. nearly all human lungs contain a strain of this bacteria, but the scar tissue prods it with his cane, seeing something has escaped from the scar tissue keeps them dormant. looks up toward morty, who is getting close to the catwalk morty! get down! 
morty: whoa! grabs hold of the catwalk as a fluid drips down onto it whoa! 
(tuberculosis begins crawling towards him. he lets go of the catwalk and bounces back down to the group, pursued by the disease.) 
morty: oh! what are those things?! 
dr bloom: tuberculosis, coming in fast! 
poncho: raises gun and starts shooting at the disease not faster than a bullet! ahh! 
dr bloom: grabs poncho s arm no! do you know what you ve done?! 
[transition to garage] 
(ruben coughs.) 
[transition to lungs] 
(the force of the cough lifts the whole group off the ground, then they fall back down.) 
dr bloom: get to the digestive tract! he s coughing! 
(the group starts running.) 
[transition to garage] 
(ruben coughs several times again.) 
[transition to lungs] 
(the group all manages to push through besides alexander. morty rushes back to help him as his dog mask is blown from his face. morty grabs a frond and reaches for alexander’s hand.) 
alexander: waaaah! don t let me die! 
[transition to garage] 
(rick looks down over ruben’s mouth.) 
rick: just take a deep breath, ruben. 
(ruben inhales deeply.) 
[transition to lungs] 
morty: you re not gonna die! what s your name? 
alexander: my name is his hand slips from morty s and he s coughed up alexandeeeeeeeer! 
(alexander’s skin and soft tissue are peeled off as ruben coughs into rick’s face, getting some spittle, including alexander, on rick’s forehead.) 
(the group, minus the now-dead alexander, escape the respiratory system. morty presses the speaker on his helmet.) 
morty: rick! ruben s got tuberculosis! 
[transition to garage] 
rick: oh, great work, morty. pulls a massive syringe form his lab coat i ll just cure it, and then 
(ruben’s heart monitor flatlines. rick tosses the syringe over his shoulder.) 
rick: okay. well i can t cure death. this is bad, morty. you re trapped in a dead man. listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor 
[transition to anatomy park] 
rick: and hop by pirates of the pancreas. obviously i m biased, but, i think it s great, morty. 
[transition to garage] 
rick: sitting in a lounge chair, pulls out a flask it s a bunch of pirates runnin around a-a-a-pancreas. we don t whitewash it either, morty. the pirates are really rapey. the top priority is to get you guys out of there, but i m just saying, if that becomes impossible 
[transition to anatomy park] 
(the group listens to rick, all looking glum.) 
rick: please, you gotta treat yourself. 
(the group is headed to the digestive tract.) 
morty: geez, what s that horrible smell? 
dr bloom: you mean the panda express? chuckles kidding, i-i m kidding. (as he speaks, poncho and roger stock up on bottled water from the panda express.) the body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas. we re inside a corpse, my boy. anatomy park is doomed. 
morty: forget about the park, doctor! how do we get out?! 
dr bloom: the digestive tract is the evacuation route. get it? there s an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all. 
morty: everybody! get to the colon! 
poncho: now i m takin orders from a twelve-year-old boy?! 
(as they walk, dr. bloom speaks privately with morty.) 
dr bloom: morty. the scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. this disaster was an inside job. keep your eyes on annie. she was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand. 
roger: intestines are ahead to the left. then the right. then left. et cetera. 
(morty slows to walk beside annie.) 
morty: hey, just so you know, i-i m actually fourteen. so, you know 
annie: what? 
morty: not twelve. 
annie: okay. 
morty: because he just said i was twelve. 
annie: oh. good for you. 
(she walks ahead of him.) 
rick through speaker: oh. oh, morty. strike one. 
morty: slumps forward nnn 
[transition to small intestine] 
(the group travel down the small intestine in a raft, surrounded by animatronics singing ‘it’s a small, small intestine.’) 
animatronics: singing it s a road of laughter, a trail of food. it s a pathway that breaks up the fat in food. it s a tube in the chest and it sends out the rest. it s a small, small intestine! 
roger: it goes on like this for miles 
dr bloom: excitedly and then we get to the large intestine! 
(a low rumbling can be heard.) 
poncho: shh. shines flashlight i hear something. 
(gonorrhea rises up from the river of waste.) 
dr bloom: whispers don t move. gonorrhea can t see us if we don t move. 
(gonorrhea roars viciously and moves towards them.) 
dr bloom: wait! i was wrong! i was thinking of a t-rex. 
(poncho pulls out a gun, but before he can fire, gonorrhea capsizes the boat and they all fall overboard. they swim to the ‘shore’ on the side of the intestine.) 
annie: we re sitting ducks! 
morty: doc! didn t you say the body was filling up with gas? 
dr bloom: yes. why? 
poncho: kid! you re a genius! pulls out a match 
dr bloom: are you mad?! 
morty: grabs annie s hand everybody! in here! 
(they all rush into a cavity in the intestinal lining. poncho lights the match.) 
poncho: hey gonorrhea! how s this for a burning sensation? 
(he throws the match towards the disease, where it ignites the gas and causes an explosion. gonorrhea falls down, dead. annie hugs morty, who laughs.) 
[transition to smith family living room] 
(leonard, summer, joyce, jacob, beth, and jerry sit in a semicircle on the carpet. jerry scowls and slumps. leonard is playing a set of bongos while summer sings.) 
summer: singing drummer, drum, drum, drum! drummer, drum, drum drum drum, christmas drums! 
leonard: oh, summer. sing it! haha. 
summer: christmas drums being played by a boy! 
(beth is clapping along when she notices jerry sulking. she puts an arm around him.) 
beth: jerry, come on. this is what you wanted. 
jerry: i get it, beth. be careful what you wish for. i m being punished for taking your ipad. 
beth: what? jerry, let that stuff go, okay? i m sorry i was a bitch earlier. let s just be here. 
(ethan walks up to the sliding glass doors and lets himself into the house.) 
ethan: ugh summer! 
summer: stands up ethan, what are you doing here? 
ethan: i ve been texting you for hours. what the hell?! 
summer: i don t have my phone! i m doing a human holiday! 
ethan: did you even consider how that might make me feel? 
summer: how you feel? why is everything always happening to you?! 
jerry: stands up summer, do you have a boyfriend? 
ethan: yeah, do you, summer? 
summer: i don t know ethan, do i? 
jacob: stands up and puts a hand on ethan and summer s shoulders jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man. 
(jerry stares at him, flabbergasted.) 
[transition to anatomy park] 
(the group runs through another metal security door and hurry down a platform to a growth ray.) 
roger: i should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray back online. if it works, we ll be regular-sized in a few minutes. i just hope ruben s not in a room with white carpets or upholstery. 
(something roars in the distance, causing the area to rumble.) 
poncho: what the hell is that? 
dr bloom: the sphincter dam. we built it when ruben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse-load. 
(the dam is clearly close to giving way. roger keeps working to get the growth ray active.) 
roger: almost got it. everybody, move inside the circle! 
(morty notices a strange, black creature in poncho’s backpack.) 
morty: poncho? what is this in your backpack? 
(poncho turns around to face morty, giving dr. bloom a view of the creature.) 
dr bloom: that s bubonic plague! what are you doing with that, poncho? 
(poncho grabs hold of annie and holds a knife to her throat. annie gasps and tries to kick free.) 
poncho: everybody get back! 
dr bloom: poncho, you son of a bitch! you released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me? 
poncho: laughs that s right, baby. a lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population. i ll take the highest bidder. al quaeda. north korea. republicans! shriners! balding men that work out! people on the internet that are only turned on by cartoons of japanese teenagers! anything is better than working for you! points the knife at dr. bloom you pompous, negligent, itunes gift card as a holiday bonus-giving 
morty: ahhhhh!!! 
(morty leaps up and grabs onto poncho’s helmet, allowing annie to escape. he punches poncho repeatedly before poncho pulls him off his face and throws him to the ground, where roger helps him up. poncho laughs evilly, but stops short when bubonic plague bites his shoulder.) 
poncho: ah! eh! get! get off! he backs up and falls over the railing ahhhh! 
(the four remaining look over the edge as he falls to his death. just then, the sphincter dam begins groaning, almost giving way.) 
annie: you guys! 
roger: it s gonna burst! urges the others on go! go, go, go! pulls a lever before trying to run after the others but catches his foot in some of the machinery my foot is stuck! 
(morty holds annie back as she makes to help roger.) 
annie: no! 
roger: this is okay! it s okay, just go! tell my family i love them! they may be hard to find because my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it too, so, i dunno, you can 
(just then, the dam bursts, drowning roger in ruben’s excrement.) 
annie: no! 
(dr. bloom seals the door to the chamber and annie hugs morty, distraught and crying.) 
[transition to smith family living room] 
(leonard, joyce, and beth sit on the chair and sofa, jerry and summer stand, and jacob kneels with ethan in the center of the room.) 
jacob: let me ask you something ethan. where s the anger coming from, man? 
ethan: from summer being a total bitch! 
(jacob takes hold of ethan’s cheeks and forces him to make eye contact.) 
jacob: where s the anger coming from? 
ethan: my brother took me fishing once in the bushes voice begins choking up as tears fill his eyes i can t i can t! covers his eyes as he starts to cry he made me feel like a girl! sobbing openly i m m-made me a girl! 
(jacob helps ethan up to his feet.) 
jacob: he didn t make you anything, man. you are who you are. gestures to summer she is who she is. (summer watches on with a sympathetic expression.) now you go to her. brand new. 
(ethan walks over to summer.) 
ethan: come here right now! 
summer: oh my god, i m so sorry ethan! they hug i love you! 
ethan: i love you so much. 
(the two begin making out. everyone claps besides jerry.) 
jerry: um 
joyce: you did it again, cubby. come here. 
(joyce and jacob begin to kiss. jerry looks to the easy chair to see leonard has gotten up and is backing into the closet, unbuttoning his shirt to reveal a superman costume underneath.) 
jerry: no! stop! i hate this! 
(beth, joyce, and jacob glare at him.) 
joyce: well, christmas doesn t revolve around what you hate, son. 
jerry: well then, i hate christmas! enjoy being human! you guys are gross and lame. 
(he walks out. summer and ethan and joyce and jacob continue kissing.) 
[transition to anatomy park] 
(the three survivors are in a small theater where an animatronic ruben gives a presentation. morty and annie have their helmets off and are making out, and dr. bloom sits a few seats away eating ice cream.) 
animatronic ruben: my name s ruben ridley. you re inside me right now, but by the end of this journey, i ll be inside all of you. 
(dr. bloom appears to miss every other bite of ice cream, probably due to his semi-aqueous form.) 
animatronic ruben: my story begins in the dot com crash in the early 90s. 
(the animatronic sparks, then goes limp.) 
annie: whispering to morty you can put your fingers wherever you want 
rick through speaker: morty, you wanna put it on mute or something? (annie and morty both look at morty s helmet, startled.) 
[transition to garage] 
(rick is working on a computer, still talking to morty through his headset.) 
rick: i m trying to concentrate. 
(jerry wanders to the door.) 
jerry: ah, rick? 
rick: holds up a hand without even looking over at him not now, jerry. i ve got much, much smaller fish to fry. 
jerry: enters anyway i wanted to say i m sorry i ever judged you. leans on the ping pong table, looking down at ruben s corpse right now, you re my sanest relative. 
(rick, who had been typing away, suddenly pauses.) 
rick: relative that s it! relative size! jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite! into his headset morty! can you get to the left nipple? 
[transition to anatomy park] 
(annie is in morty’s lap.) 
morty: are you kidding? i m hoping i can get to both of them, rick. 
rick through speaker: morty, i m talkin about ruben s left nipple! 
(the area begins to rumble and cave in. morty lifts annie off his lap and both put on their helmets.) 
morty: we need to get to the left nipple! 
dr bloom: the body is decaying! (bits of debris begin to fall from the ceiling .) the arterial transit system is useless! we can try the service shuttle. it s connected to the skeletal system. that s why we call it the bone train. to annie would you like to ride the bone train, miss? 
annie: if it ll get us out of here. 
dr bloom: how about you, morty? would you like to ride the bone train? 
morty: why are you doing this bit? we re gonna die. let s go. 
[transition to garage] 
(jerry looks on as rick inserts a bundle of dynamite into an incision on ruben’s abdomen. he takes a few steps back toward the door back to the house.) 
jerry: well, i can see that you re busy merry christmas, rick. 
(rick lifts ruben’s corpse from the table and heads out to the car, dumping ruben’s body inside.) 
trans anatomy park: the bone train] 
dr bloom: there s no autopilot. one of us will have to stay here and operate it manually. 
(morty and annie glance at each other, then look back at dr. bloom. dr. bloom glances at each of the teenagers. morty and annie continue staring at him.) 
morty: uh, well 
dr bloom: no, you re right. it was a dick move for me to even pause like that. this is all my fault. you go on. 
(something approaches the group from a nearby set of stairs.) 
annie: points what the hell is that? 
dr bloom: e. coli outbreak. hurry! 
(morty and annie jump into the shuttle as e. coli swarm the area. dr. bloom pulls a lever and the shuttle begins to move.) 
dr bloom: oh wait, there is an autopilot. (e. coli surround him.) waaait!... okay, never mind, i wanted to sacrifice myself anywaaaaayyyy! 
(as the train speeds down the track, some of the e. coli have attached themselves to the vehicle. one smashes the window of the train door and sticks its head inside.) 
annie: they re chewing through the doors! 
morty: euuuugh! grabs a fire extinguisher and beats the e. coli off the train with it we re in the areola, rick! almost to the nipple! but we re also in a really bad situation! 
[transition to earth’s orbit] 
(rick flies his spacecraft out of earth’s atmosphere.) 
rick: i m almost there, morty! 
(rick lights the end of the dynamite bundle in ruben’s abdomen, kicks him out into space, and uses a growth ray to increase ruben to an enormous size—large enough to make morty and annie their normal sizes again, but still inside him.) 
[transition to earth] 
(various people across america stop what they’re doing and look at the sky as ruben’s huge, naked corpse hovers overhead.) 
reporter: reports are coming in from across the country about what appears to be a giant naked man over the continental united states. we now go to tom randolph in new york. tom? 
(as tom speaks, ruben’s terrifyingly enormous face floats overhead.) 
tom: well, his eyes aren t twinkling, and his dimples aren t merry, but i m standing under a nose like a seventy-mile cherry! 
reporter: thank you, tom. let s go now to eric mcman in los angeles. 
(ruben’s poorly kept toes hover in the background while eric speaks.) 
eric: we ve got feet here on the west coast, bill! giant feet, even relative to the giant man s size! and you know what they say about that! 
reporter: well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what is going down in the rocky mountains. 
[transition to rocky mountains] 
(a lumberjack pauses while hacking down a tree, looks up, screams, and runs away.) 
[transition to earth’s orbit] 
(rick flies his ship toward the nipple.) 
[transition to bone train] 
(e. coli continue trying to break in, with morty beating them away with a fire extinguisher. running up to the front of the train, he and annie see that hepatitis a is has damaged the track.) 
morty: oh my god, the track! 
annie: it s hepatitis a! 
(as morty tries to slow the train down, it flies off the track and straight through some of ruben’s soft tissue, bursting into the nipple. the train hits a bump, throwing morty and annie out. they look up and gasp.) 
annie: the nipple hole 
(through the nipple hole, they’re able to see earth as the sun peeks over the horizon.) 
morty: it s beautiful 
(suddenly, there’s a crash behind them. hepatitis a bursts out from the train wreckage and lumbers towards morty and annie.) 
annie: aw no! 
(the two run, and just as hepatitis a is about to catch them, hepatitis c snatches it up and shakes it like felled prey.) 
annie: whoa! it s hepatitis c! 
(hepatitis c gives them a thumbs-up before lumbering away with its kill in its mouth.) 
morty: um we did we have some sort of relationship with him? 
annie: i think they re just like that? i think they re just good guys. 
morty: oh. huh. 
(rick flies his spaceship into the nipple, landing it behind them. morty and annie climb inside.) 
rick: where s dr. bloom? 
morty: sorry rick he s dead 
rick: goddamn it, morty, i ask you to do one thing! 
(rick flies the spaceship out of the nipple and away from ruben’s corpse just before the dynamite ignites and the body explodes, sending blood and gore in all directions.) 
[transition to smith residence] 
(joyce, leonard, jacob, beth, summer, and ethan all bundle up to go sledding.) 
beth: jerry doesn t know what he s missing. 
jacob: he ll come around, beth. christmas is a special time. it has funny ways of bringing families together. 
beth: i dunno, jacob. jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. i don t know if our marriage will 
(beth stops talking as blood starts splattering the sliding glass doors. the whole group stares in shock as blood seems to pour from the sky.) 
summer: it s raining blood! 
jacob: listen, find jerry! 
beth: oh god. 
[transition to jerry’s den] 
(blood is raining on the window there as well. jerry is sitting in a chair, watching the news, when the family bursts in.) 
beth: jerry! 
jerry: stands and hugs her it s alright! the tv says there s nothing to worry about. 
reporter on tv: the giant naked sky santa has exploded. blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country. everything should be fine. 
(family sighs in relief.) 
summer: dad, can i have my phone back? 
jerry: sure, sweetie. pulls out the stocking and gives summer her phone, then gives beth her tablet everybody, take a device. it ll help you relax. 
jacob: this is nice. 
jerry: yeah. puts an arm around beth and jacob i guess we really learned something this christmas, jacob. 
summer: no we didn t, dad. no we didn t. 
[transition to smith house] 
(it’s no longer raining blood, but reddish chunks of ruben are everywhere as rick lands his spacecraft, parking it in the garage.) 
rick: too bad about dr. bloom. rick, annie, and morty exit the car he was a genius. the only man capable of creating a new anatomy park. 
annie: actually, i studied dr. bloom s work. i believe i have the knowledge necessary to create a new, much safer park! 
rick: what about pirates of the pancreas ? 
annie: i think it was one of the most underrated attractions. 
rick: booyah! hold your breath! 
(annie is already standing under the shrink ray as rick pulls the lever, shrinking her down to microscopic size once again, much to morty’s chagrin.) 
morty: hey, wh-wh-what the hell, rick? what the hell, man? i liked her! i really had somethin going there, rick! 
(rick pockets the container holding annie.) 
rick: yeah, so i heard. you dodged a bullet, morty, trust me. whispers puffy vagina. 
morty: w-what s wrong with that? that doesn t sound like a problem to me! i dunno! 
rick: c mon. let s get some stuffing, i m starving. 
[transition to smith family living room] 
(beth, leonard, summer, and ethan sit on the couch, jacob sits in the easy chair with joyce in his lap, and jerry sits on the carpet. all are staring at handheld electronics as rick and morty enter the room.) 
rick: oh, unbelievable. we got a bunch of robot computer people sittin around with their faces stuffed in computer screens. (no one acknowledges him.) do you realize christ was born today? jesus christ our savior was born today! a-a-a-are you people even human? what kind of christmas is this? 
(jerry looks at the audience and shrugs.) 
[end credits roll] 
[transition to rick’s garage] 
annie through speaker phone: hey rick! rick, can you hear me? 
rick: loud and clear, annie. 
annie: great! we re also on with alejandro, our chief imaginarian 
alejandro: hey rick. 
annie: natalie jacobs and chris desiter from microscopic marketing, zach from organ concepts and jamie from new media. 
rick: hey everybody. 
all: hey, hi rick, how s it goin . (etc.) 
annie: so. pirates of the pancreas. 
rick: yeah, talk to me. 
alejandro: hey rick, it s alejandro speaking. um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked ourselves over here, okay, what does a pancreas do? (rick begins to look agitated.) and the answer was, does it make pirates? no. it makes insulin, you know? so we re starting with a new 
(rick, furious, picks up and slams the phone, hanging up on the group call. behind him, ethan lies on a table.) 
ethan: so those guys are inside me, huh? like, building a park? 
rick: those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, ethan! they re inside you building a monument to compromise! fuck. fuck those people. fuck this whole thing, ethan. 
ethan: cool. and who pays me? 
[end] 
open ext. rick's ship in flying through a planet's rings (morty is in the backseat, summer is in the starboard seat, rick is driving) 
all: (singing) love. connection. experience. 
(morty claps) 
rick: yeah morty 
all: (singing) come together. with love. connection, experience![laughter] 
rick: it's my favourite song 
morty: hahahahaha, yeah 
(distress beacon alert chimes) 
rick: oh yeah, distress beacon![belches] yeah baby! 
morty: you're excited about that? 
rick: the first rule of space travel kids, is always check out distress beacons; nine out of ten times its a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit! 
[rick makes a sharp turn] 
morty and summer: whoa! 
rick: one out of ten times its a deadly trap, but i'm ready to roll those dice! 
[transition to flying toward s.s. independence] 
[transition to rick, morty, and summer entering corridor] 
summer: seems like something terrible happened here. 
rick: yeah. cha-ching. oh yeah, if you find a room full of eggs, don't shy away from it, give one of them a shake. those facehuggers are worth more than this ship. 
(rick is spray-painting a symbol on a closed door) 
morty: uh, what's that? 
rick: this will make the cops write it up as a looting by the korblocks. 
summer: that's horrible! 
rick: i hear you man, cops are racist. 
(a door behind them opens with six crewmembers) 
rick: oh, hey! you're alive! thank god. 
female alien: can you help us? our planet was taken over by some kind of[pauses] entity! it absorbed the minds of our people! 
male alien 1: we didn't notice until it was too late. the people it takes over, they look like your friends, your family, your leaders, but they're not, themselves any more; they're part of it. 
rick: and how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you? those two ding-dongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing. 
(two male aliens are calm and not panting and standing apart from the other four) 
(they screech after rick points at them) 
male alien with glasses: hey! no, no-uurgh! 
(morty screams. the other four are assimilated) 
rick: called it. 
all six aliens together: hello rick. long time no see. 
rick: unity!? 
morty: rick? 
summer: grandpa? 
rick: oh boy. uh, these are my grandkids, summer and morty. summer, morty, this is uh, unity. we sort of used to, uh, date. 
[intro credits begin] 
[scene's of life on unity's planet are shown; s.s. independence lands] 
rick: quite an operation you got going here une. you're a whole planet now huh? 
unity administrator: after we broke up, i spend some time wandering through space, 
unity thin suited man: then i found this world, 
unity large suited man: where i was better able to focus on my passion for unification. 
summer: you mean stealing peoples bodies? 
rick: summer, rude. why don't you kids run off and play with unity while unity and i do some catching up. 
(four aliens come over to morty and summer put a hand on their shoulders) 
summer: ugh. 
morty: wait! rick, aren't these people going to barf into our mouths and absorb us? 
unity administrator: you're guests here on my planet, you're free to be yourselves; i've never been good at disappointing rick. 
summer: well now i'm going to barf. come on morty. 
[transition to to garage; jerry is rooting through shelves] 
beth: jerry, what are you-what are you doing in here? 
jerry: i m trying to find our weed whacker, cause our weeds are wack, yo. 
beth: but you can t go in the garage when rick s not here. 
jerry: i can t? 
beth: well, he doesn t like it. 
jerry: what s he gonna do, crash rent-free at his other family s house? 
beth: what is that supposed to mean? 
(jerry stands up and turns to face beth) 
jerry: your dad gets to walk all over us because of your abandonment issues! he s playing you, shorty. 
beth: oh, stop affecting that stupid hip-hop dialect! 
jerry: stop shifting the crosshairs to my ironic urban patois just because your relationship with your father is toe-up from the flow-up. 
(gurgling sounds come from below. beth and jerry look around) 
jerry: what the hell was that? 
beth: (whispering) i don t know, let s just leave! 
(more gurgling. jerry removes the mat to reveal a hatch in the floor.) 
jerry: that is a hatch! your father put a hatch in my garage! 
beth: you don t know it was him![pauses] anyway, we re not supposed to be in here! 
jerry: obviously, neither is whatever s gurgling down there. 
(gurgling) 
trans to unity s planet: rick is approaching a news stand] 
rick: world peace achieved. nice! a little weird to publish a paper about it for yourself, but hey. so what s next? 
unity newsagent: after i become a type-one civilisation, this world will be invited into the galactic federation. 
rick: oh, goody. 
(as rick walks, unity switches between people nearby to have a flawless conversation without having to stop what they’re doing) 
unity customer: from there i ll have access to countless planets and species. 
unity pedestrian: one by one, i will unify them, i will become the universe, and i will be what the single-minded once called a god. 
rick:[burps] i like that. oh, that s pretty sexy. hey listen, where can i get a drink around here? 
unity old woman: recreational substances were phased out here. there s no need for escape from the self when your world is one. 
rick: unity, unity, who am i talking to? i watched you assimilate a whole police station just to get your hands on the evidence locker. 
unity worker: rick, when we met i was a young hivemind with the population of a small town. people change. 
unity busker: especially when i change them. i m sorry to disappoint you, but i ve grown. 
rick: hey, listen, i ve grown too. i have! see, i ve-i ve reconnected with my family, right? 
unity police officer: hm, why is that i wonder? 
rick: maybe it s part of getting old. maybe i just miss being with a collective. 
(rick and unity start kissing. a crowd forms around them) 
unity crowd: yes rick! yes! yes! 
rick: oh yeah! 
unity crowd: yes! yes! 
rick: wait, wait, stop! h-hold it! not like this. we need a hang glider. and a crotchless uncle sam costume. and i want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked redheads! and i want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father! 
[transition to to a mountain being carved into the shape of morty and summer’s heads. morty and summer are being fanned and eating hamburgers] 
morty: look at em go! so coordinated! what s your problem? they re making you into a mount rushmore! they made burgers! 
summer: morty, open your eyes! there is no they! these poor people s bodies are being used! they re a planet of puppets! 
unity fan holder: i can hear you. 
summer: ugh! 
morty: well, seems like everybody here s cool with it. except for all those redheads. they seem like they re in a hurry to be somewhere else. 
unity clown: balloon, summer? balloon, morty? 
summer: no, we don t want your dumb balloons. we re bored. take us back to rick. 
unity clown: now s not a good time. 
[transition to to rick in a hang glider and uncle sam costume, flying towards a stadium] 
rick: oh yeah! i want youuuuuu! 
unity stadium: go son go! go son go! go son go! 
trans to earth: jerry and beth are looking down the hatch, which is open] 
jerry: oh! real nice! real nice! how does a man do this without me noticing? 
beth: oh, you know my dad. once he puts his mind to something 
jerry: you re spinning this to his credit? 
(gurgling) 
jerry: i m going down there. 
beth: jerry! 
jerry: beth, this is my house, which makes this my garage, my secret hatch, my hidden subterranean lair, and my faceless gargler. now, are you going to keep hating this playa, or are you gonna jack my steed? 
beth: okay, you re just making stuff up now. 
[transition to to rick, who’s walking out in a bathrobe, panting, to applause] 
rick: oh my god. oh my god.[drinks water] 
unity redheads: oh rick, it was so bad. 
rick: what s this was stuff? i just need to hydrate and then we re doing that again! 
(beta-7’s spaceships arrive from skyward) 
unity redhead: oh damn. 
rick: listen, if this is an invasion i gotta sit this one out, but i ll-i ll be back to have sex with the survivors. 
unity redhead: it s a neighboring hivemind species, beta-7. our planet s maintained a practical alliance for exchange of vital resources. (whispering) so be nice! 
beta-7: unity.[pauses] is it a bad time? are all present lifeforms assimilated? 
unity man with glasses: beta-7, this is my single-minded friend from earth, rick. 
beta-7: rick sanchez. unity has spoken of you. 
rick: all bad i hope.[laughing] 
(rick laughs and puts his hand on the lead beta-7’s shoulders. all beta-7 assimilated scream and point at rick) 
rick: whoa, jesus christ! 
unity redhead: beta-7, if my allies are a problem for you perhaps our alliance is as well. 
beta-7: our alliance is beneficial. when beta-7 expresses concern it-it s only be-because 
rick: oh snap! powdered neutronium? amphetetron? you know what i can make with this stuff? 
unity redhead: oh rick, i-i shouldn t... 
rick: come on, it s not every day that i m in town! it-it s for old time s sake. 
unity redhead: uh okay, what the hell! we can purify the resin and make fractal dust! 
rick: oh, i was thinking velocitinis, but 
unity: aww, old man rick can t party with the whole planet? 
(both laugh) 
rick: i can do whatever you do and more, baby. 
beta-7: hrmm 
(beta-7 leaves) 
rick: you know, i think beta-7 over there is hoping your alliance can be more than practical. 
(both laugh) 
[transition to to rick’s underground lair. jerry is searching with a flashlight.] 
jerry: well, this explains the six thousand dollar electric bill. 
(both see blim blam chained up to a wall and yell) 
blim blam:[gurgling] 
jerry: well. nice. real nice. alien prisoners under the house. real nice. nice. reeeal- 
beth: goddamn it, stop. 
[transition to to unity’s planet, summer is in the street on a soapbox with a megaphone] 
summer: wake up people! you have to fight it! you re under the spell of an evil monster! 
unity man with glasses: i can hear you. 
summer: yeah! so you keep saying! 
(she starts slapping the man) 
morty: summer! 
summer: wake up! you have to have some individuality left in there! 
unity steven phillips: why do you hate me, summer? 
summer: i m not talking to you! i m talking to 
(she reaches into his pocket and grabs his wallet, and flips over to his license) 
summer:... steven phillips! steven! set yourself free! 
unity steven phillips: summer, before i took over this planet, this man was a registered sex offender. 
summer:... yeah, well so what? at least he was himself. 
unity m biologist: this woman was a drug addict on the verge of suicide. now she s a marine biologist. 
morty: listen unity, i don t think my sister s trying to say that life would be perfect without you. i think she s just saying that life would be you know, life. 
unity old man: i have transformed life here into a paradise. prostitutes are now scientists. the homeless are now phisosophers. 
summer: oh, phi-phisosophers? 
unity old man: philophiluh phiphophibup... 
summer: oh my god. where did you learn to talk you grandpa-stealing slut? 
unity old man: i m feeling urk! 
(the man falls down and vomits. all other assimilated in the area follow suit.) 
morty: oh man! let me help all of you guys up! 
unity all: i m fine! 
[transition to to penis-shaped house. various assimilated are dancing. rick is on the couch drinking] 
unity administrator: do you know what i love about you, rick? you re the only single mind i ve met who really sees the big picture. 
rick: you got that right. but baby, listen. y-you re talking about taking over planets and galaxies, you gotta you gotta just remember to let go sometimes, you know. 
unity administrator: i can let go! hey, look! you see that town across the river? watch this. 
(planes fly past and bomb the town, blowing it all up) 
rick: whoa! 
unity administrator: ha ha! woot! 
rick: whoa! that s not what i meant! 
unity administrator:[laughing] it s okay! it s okay, i evacuated! i evacuated the town, look! 
unity townspeople: hey! right here! we re fine! 
rick:[laughing] oh, that was awesome! my grandkids weren t in that town, right? a-are my grandkids alive? h-hey, my drink is empty. 
[transition to to street. more assimilated are dancing, though they’re falling over and puking. vehicles crash. morty and summer are running and almost get crushed by falling beams.] 
morty and summer: aah! 
summer: unity, what s happening? 
steven phillips: who s unity? you kids have nice feet. mind if i take a picture? 
summer: gross, no! 
(he takes a picture anyway and wanders off) 
morty: i think you re getting what you wanted, summer. something s happening to unity. 
summer: do all of you remember who you are? 
ron benson:... yeah. my name is ron benson. i m an electrical engineer. father of two, and as you can see from my flat concentric nipple rings, i m a member of this planet s top race![opens shirt to reveal ring nipples] 
summer: okay, that s good! uh don t focus too much on the last part, but... 
daryl jefferson: i m daryll jefferson. i m a landscaper. and i ll be damned if that ripple-nipple bitch s race is superior![removes shirt] the cone-nipple people will rule this world! 
ron benson: you shut your mouth, you dirty knife-nipple bastards! 
daryl jefferson: what d you say to me, you target-chested piece of shit? 
alien man: race war! 
(the crowd breaks out into fighting) 
summer: why are you fighting? can t you see you re all the same? 
morty: ah, summer. ha ha. first race war, huh? 
morty: way to go, summer. you started a race war. 
summer: i didn t start it! they re the racists! i i merely empowered them to follow their apparently misguided dreams! 
morty: okay, thanks for clarifying! y-i ll have a super accurate headstone now! 
rioter: hey wait, what race are you guys? 
morty:[pulling up shirt] we re neither! s-see? 
summer: yeah, take my word for it. we just have regular nipples. 
rioter: hey! these two freaks have no race! 
(morty and summer run, and get chased by a gang of rioters, before getting cornered against a wall) 
morty: oh, there s no place like home! there s no place like home! remember, summer? 
summer: oh 
(the two hug) 
morty: from dorothy and the tiny people movie? 
summer: o-oh, yes, yes yes 
morty: all the tiny people? 
summer: dorothy, take us away! take us away! 
(as the rioters get closer, unity (swat) drops in and surrounds the two, pushing the rioters back. an assimilated drops down and pulls the two into a hovercopter) 
unity swat: hello summer. hello morty. 
unity pilot: it s okay! you re safe now. 
morty: u-unity? 
unity swat: yes. 
summer: oh, unity i am so sorry. i didn t know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks! i was thinking more of a choose-your-own-cellphone-carrier thing. 
unity pilot: oh, summer, you did nothing wrong! i m having fun with your grandpa! lost a little control. probably shouldn t be piloting a hovercopter, nor should i be running two hundred thousand pediatric hospitals and twelve million deep friers, but hey! it s not like this planet can take its business elsewhere! 
morty: um should we maybe stop somewhere and get you a coffee? maybe splash a little water on your face, or ? 
unity pilot: no, no, if i wanted to be sober, i wouldn t have gotten drunk! wooohoooo! 
[transition to to rick’s underground lair. blim blam is chained up, beth and jerry are arguing] 
jerry: oh man. i cannot wait. i cannot wait to hear rick explain his way around this. he is gone! 
beth: jerry, stop! please, okay, we weren t even supposed to be down here. if we confront him about this- 
jerry: oh my god! i love this! i love that this is how far you will go for him. you wanna go upstairs, and cut carrots, and watch a lifetime original, above a fucking alien dungeon! your relationship with your father is psychotic! 
beth: oh listen to you relish the idea that my genius father is a bad person! step out of your ego for a second and look at this thing! it s a monster! he might have it chained up so that it doesn t eat the planet! 
jerry: right, because your father s such an altruist? i once saw him briefly forget the word for humans! he s probably harvesting this creature s organs! 
beth: he s probably racing to cure its space aids! 
jerry: he s going to eat it! 
beth: he s protecting it! 
blim blam:[gurgles] 
both: shut up! 
[transition to to penis-shaped house, now on fire. summer and morty enter.] 
summer: unity! this place is a mess! 
unity administrator: oh, it s cool! the part of me that s the cleaning lady is coming on friday.[gasps] oh my god! i have a meeting at the galactic federation in an hour. oh, i ll never make it! ah, i ll push it to next week. 
morty: unity, could you get rick out here please? 
unity administrator: he s unavailable! he s- 
summer: having sex with you, we get it! gross. get him out here now. 
unity administrator: i don t think he wants to be- 
summer: (shouting) grandpa rick! 
morty: (shouting) rick! rick! 
summer: (shouting) i m gonna tell mom and dad about the gagoo you have locked up under the garage! 
(rick stumbles out, topless, wearing an ammunition belt, a mexican hat and pants, a fake moustache and clutching a bottle of beer) 
rick: what the hell is your problem? 
summer: grandpa, we need to go home! now! 
rick: fine, geez! 
(he opens a portal) 
rick: see ya! 
morty: uh, rick? i think we should all go. 
rick: tend your garden, kids, i m kinda doing a thing here. 
(he puts his arms around two assimilated, who cheer and laugh) 
summer: grandpa rick, we re not leaving without you! 
rick: oh my god[belches] you guys i get it. you re afraid the big bad hivemind is gonna steal your grandpa away. 
summer: actually, no. i think unity s great and you re a horrible influence on it! 
rick: what? 
morty: this isn t healthy, rick! y-you know you-you re really up to no good around here. i-at-at this place, you know? 
summer: you and unity are like like leggings and mid-calf boots. you think you re great together but you re just bringing out the worst in each other! 
rick: oh, gee, boy summer, well put. uh, why don t we see what unity thinks. unity? 
unity shades guy: i m just taking a little break from stuff. you know? i need to relax. 
rick: oh, hey, wh-what s this on the news, guys? l-l-let me turn it up. 
unity todd: in the news today, this looks a lot worse than it is. we re really just having a good time. karen? 
unity karen: thanks, todd. up next are you a concerned grandchild or just a buzzkill? we ll tell you how you can really know for sure! 
rick: i think you two are a little outnumbered. 
summer: okay! well, what if you did it for me? what if you came with us as a favour to us because you love us? 
rick: what? dumb. bye. 
morty: but rick, summer s just- 
rick: summer s just a hyper-emotional, needy little-what s the word i m looking for here uh-human! it runs in the family! i can tolerate it but i can t give a crap about it. take a hike. 
summer: take care of yourself, unity. 
(summer and morty leave through the portal) 
rick: i m not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. can you assimilate a giraffe? 
[transition to back to beth and jerry] 
beth: you re the worst! 
jerry: no! you re the worst! you don t support this family! 
(the two start yelling over the top of one another) 
jerry: all you care about is yourself! 
beth: you think supporting the family is about supporting you emotionally... 
jerry: you ve got two children being dragged across the cosmos... 
beth:... but you re unsupportable! because it s never enough, jerry! 
jerry:... by your dangerously ill father, and you force me to watch it happen! 
beth: it will never be enough support to satisfy you! and you don t even know what it s like 
jerry: because you d rather lose them and lose me than lose him! 
beth: to be afraid of losing anything because you cling and you cling and you cling 
jerry: and why? because you re the child, beth. you, not me, you! 
(blim blam gurgles angrily and breaks free) 
jerry: aaah! 
beth: oh my god! 
(both back away. jerry puts his arm protectively in front of beth. blim blam moves past them and breaks into a cabinet, before pulling out an object and pointing it at the two like a gun) 
beth and jerry: aah! 
(blim blam pushes the object into his neck) 
blim blam: um, first of all, hello. uh, my name is blim blam the korblok. second of all, cards on the table i am a murderer that eats babies and i came to this planet to eat babies. however, i am also carrying a highly infectious disease, that i suppose you could call space aids as you put it, and rick did chain me up so that he could attempt to cure it. at the same time, rick s motivation to cure my disease was not to save my life or anyone else s, but to patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarks. but you know the reason why i ripped my chains out of the wall? and do you know why i m never coming back to this planet? because the two of you are the fucking worst! you both hate yourselves and each other! and the idea that it has anything to do with rick is laughable! i d laugh but i m biologically incapable, that s how alien i am! and even i m sitting here listening to the two of you, and being like, what the fuck! so! good luck with your shitty marriage, and i m sorry that rick has to deal with either of you. blim blam, out! 
(he drops the translator and leaves, but quickly rushes back to pick it up again) 
blim blam: you know what? i m taking this. 
[transition to to garage. summer and morty have returned. blim blam pushes at the garage door but can’t open it] 
blim blam: how do you-what is this? 
(morty activates the garage door opener) 
blim blam: uh, is there a slow setting? best door ever. 
(he leaves, flipping the two off with a penis-shaped finger) 
[transition to to rick, who’s on the couch watching tv surrounded by several assimilated] 
rick: aaah![coughs] okay, okay, now make him cry. but happy cry. now make em all make fun of the blonde one. now make em all do it on the table! i can t believe you created a whole show for me. now cancel it! okay, now put it back on. haha![pauses] alright, i m bored. 
unity administrator: rick, is there a way for you to call summer and morty? i feel bad that they- 
rick: pfft, screw those guys! uugh, i ll be right back. don t waste your brain on those weirdos, unity. they re no different from any other aimless chumps that you occupy. they just put you at the centre of their lives because you re powerful and then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful. never gonna happen though, right? 
unity all: never. 
rick: never! back in a flash. 
(rick goes into the bathroom, and washes his hands and face) 
rick: best weekend ever, rick! i agree, rick! let s see how long we can go! 
(he goes back into the main room. unity has disappeared, but there are letters everywhere) 
rick: hey une! you got any more- 
(he picks up a note and reads it. unity talks in a voiceover, using the voices of different assimilated for each part) 
unity voiceover: rick, forgive me for doing this in notes. i m not strong enough to do it in persons. 
(rick starts wandering around town. the entire town is fil'led with letters. he picks up to read some as he goes) 
unity voiceover: i realise now that i m attracted to you for the same reason i can t be with you. you can t change. and i have no problem with that, but it clearly means i have a problem with myself. 
unity voiceover: i m sure there s no perfect version of me. i m sure i ll just unify species after species and never really be complete. 
unity voiceover: but i know how it goes with us. i lose who i am and become part of you. because in a strange way you re better at what i do without even trying. yours, and nobody else s, unity. p. s. i don t know where those coal miners were before they got assimilated. you might want to get checked. 
[transition to to the smiths watching tv in the living room. rick enters from the left] 
rick: hey. 
beth: dad [clears throat] i um jerry and i were looking for our weed whacker, and found your subterranean lair and your alien prisoner. and he got away. and i know i sound like mom but i can t sacrifice this whole family s safety just because i m afraid you ll leave again, so no more alien prisoners, and, no more subterranean excavation without consulting us. 
rick: okay. 
beth:... okay? y-y-y-y-okay like you re gonna quietly teleport somewhere and never come back? 
rick: no. it s your house. 
summer: grandpa rick! what happened with unity? 
rick: who? oh. unity. yeah, well, i mean honestly we re talking about an entity that thrives on enslavement, you know. it s not cool. fun s fun but who needs it? i ll be in the garage. 
(“do you feel it?” by chaos chaos starts playing in the background. rick enters the garage, looking depressed, and drains his flask before throwing it away. then he pulls out two bulbs and puts together a metal contraption on the desk. he pulls a frozen alien creature out of the drawers and brings it to life with a flask of chemicals, strokes it while it shrieks helplessly, and drinks the rest of the chemicals. he puts one of the bulbs into the contraption and sticks the alien under it, disintegrating it with a blast of energy, then replaces the bulb and repeats the process with his own head. at the last second, he falls unconscious, dodging the killing blast. the screen zooms out through the open garage door, showing rick slumped still on the desk through the night and into the morning, even as jerry shows up, happily weeding the garden and the driveway without noticing rick.) 
[credits] 
[after credits scene rick’s spaceship is outside beta-7’s main ship. rick is driving, with morty in the passenger seat] 
rick: unity! unity! unity! 
(a transmission comes in from beta-7) 
beta-7: how can i assist you? 
rick: i wanna talk to[belches] unity. beta-7, i know it s in there! 
beta-7: you re classified as a hostile entity, and unity doesn t want to talk to you. 
rick: i know your game, beta-7, i ve met a billion of you, you little on-deck in-the-wind shoulder to cry on! 
beta-7: you are classified as a hostile entity. 
rick: well, you re just loving this, mother f-this isn t gonna shape out like you think, pal! unity s not into other hiveminds! it s gonna suck you in and use you up and a month from now i m going to be making out with all of you in a bunch of red wigs! unity! unity! unity, i know you can hear me! get out here! 
beta-7: weapons systems engaged. 
rick: oh, in your dreams you have weapons systems. 
morty: ugh, rick, you said we were going to a movie. 
rick: we are, morty. alright, beta-shit-7, you just got saved by the bell, bitch! 
[episode end] 
rick: "they're no different from any of the aimless chumps that you occupy, they just put you at the center of their lives because your powerful then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful. never gonna happen tho right." 
unity: "never" 
unity: "rick, forgive me for doing this in notes, i'm not strong enough to do it in persons, i realize now that i am attracted to you for the same reason i cant be with you. you can't change and i have no problem with that but it clearly means, i have a problem with myself. i'm sure theres no perfect version of me im sure i'll just unify species after species and never be complete but i know how it goes with us, i lose who i am and become part of you. as in a strange way you're better at what i do without even trying, yours and noody elses' unity ps. i don't know what those coal miners was before i assimilated, you might want to get checked"
morty: i got to tell you, rick, it's pretty great to be in this spaceship, just the two of us, you know? just cruising around, rick and morty style, 
rick: i agree, morty, [belches] it's nice to get back to the basics after a pretty intense, mixed-bag of a year, 
morty: ohh! 
rick: relax, that's what windshields are for, 
rick: i didn't know that there were bugs out in space, 
morty: well, w-what did you think, morty? life just developed on earth by itself? here, let me take care of this, 
morty: geez, rick, that's disgusting, i don't want to look at that, 
rick: yeah, guess i'm out of fluid, l-let me find a place to stop, hey, muchacho, does your planet have wiper fluid yet, or are you gonna freak out and start worshipping us? 
villager: the general store ought to have what you need, 
rick: thanks, 
villager: of course, you'll be wanting to be gone from here by sundown, 
rick: yeah, sure thing, wait a minute, what? why? 
villager: sundown is when the festival begins, 
morty: the festival? 
villager: ooh, well, for millennia, our society has been free of crime and war, living in perfect peace, 
rick: oh, i know what this is! you've been able to sustain world peace because you have one night a year where you all run around robbing and murdering each other without consequence, 
villager: that's right, 
morty: what?! 
rick: it's like"the purge,"morty, that movie"the purge"? 
villager: oh, have you been here before? 
rick: no, no, but i've been to a few planets with the same gimmick, you know, sometimes it's called the cleansing or the red time, there was this one world that called it just murder night, i-it's a purge planet, they're peaceful, and then, you know, they just purge, 
morty: t-that's horrible! 
rick: yeah, you want to check it out? 
[ electricity crackling ] 
rick: so, what do you do during the festival? you lock yourself in, or you go out and do some stuff? 
shopkeeper: oh, i do some pretty bad stuff, 
rick: oh, i bet you do, old timer,[laughs] 
morty: gee--rick, come on, the sun is setting, w-we got to get out of here, 
rick: all right, well, w-what do i owe you for the wiper fluid? 
shopkeeper: oh it's on the house, oh, and, uh, why--why don't you have some candy bars, as well? 
rick: oh, no way, that's really nice of you, 
shopkeeper: i'm a nice guy... for now,[chuckling] 
rick: ohh, i don't doubt it, 
morty: rick! 
rick: yeah, yeah, hey, have a good festival, old timer, 
shopkeeper: i intend to, 
morty: rick, unlock it! 
rick: just a second, morty, oh, look at that sunset, 
morty: stop screwing around, 
[ click ] 
rick: there we go, much better, now we can see, 
morty: great, 
rick: hey, you know what, morty? why don't we christen our squeaky-clean windshield here by watching a little of this purge through it? 
morty: what?! no! what is your problem?! 
rick: morty, grow up, if you don't want to watch, don't watch, but, you know, it's my car,[belches] also, if you tell your mom about this,-i'll purge you, 
morty: you're the worst, and this planet is the worst, how can you be into this? you know, people are gonna kill each other, 
rick: so, what, y-y-you trying to sit here and tell me that[belches] i-if--if there's a video online with someone getting decapitated,-you don't click on it? 
morty: no! why--why would i do that? you do that? 
rick: i don't, because it would bore me, i see[bleep] like that for breakfast, morty, but if you don't do it, i say it's because you're afraid of your own primal instincts, so you stuff them down and-- 
[ bell chiming ] 
rick: oh, oh! shh, shh, it's starting,-oh-ho-ho! here we go, 
morty: i'm not watching, 
rick: yeah, yeah, yeah, your medal's in the mail,-i'm gonna get a closer look, morty oh, okay, sure, and then someone's gonna throw a rock and hit the car and then we're gonna crash and we're gonna be stuck down there and it's gonna be what we deserve, 
rick: yawn, whoa! 
[ indistinct shouting ] 
rick: whoa, they are purging the[bleep] out of each other, 
[ muffled screaming ] 
rick: oh, my god! oh[bleep] that was--okay, yeah, t-that was gross, wow, man, i think my eyes were bigger than my stomach on this one, morty, ugh, my appetite for purge-spectating got filled pretty quick, oh, god,[grunts][retching] 
arthrisha:[woman screaming] get away from me! no! no! help! somebody help me! aah! 
rick: all right, morty, l-let's get out of here, 
morty: wait, wait, wait, hold on, w-we have to go down there, 
rick:[belching] what? why? that poor girl, w-we have to save her, uh, morty, in space, we have something we call the non-interference policy, we got the wiper fluid, we watched them kill each other, we're leaving, 
morty: help me save that girl, or i'm telling mom you brought me here, 
rick: you little turd, 
arthrisha:[screaming] please! leave me alone! 
purger: leave you alone? during a purge? i don't think so, baby, 
morty: it's okay, we're not gonna hurt you, my name is morty, this is my grandpa, we're tourists, rick not anymore, 
<hyphen> aah!  -aah!  rick: oh, my god, this is[bleep] awesome! morty, this is really cool, hey, y-you want to help me out here and kill some people? it's fun, we're totally justified because we're saving a little girl, i mean, w-w-we're both free and clear to murder these people, 
morty: are you okay? arthrisha yes, i have to find somewhere to hide, 
morty: well, you can hide with us, rick? 
rick: yeah? 
morty: do you think we could take--w-what's your name? 
arthrisha: arthrisha, 
morty: could we take arthrisha up in the ship and, you know, just wait out the purge? 
rick: oh, morty, how can i refuse after all you've done to blackmail me? 
arthrisha: your vehicle--is it from the gods? 
morty: no, 
rick: yes, 
morty: so, uh, you know, when the purge started, did people get into it right away, or were they like,"wait, what? this is gonna stop crime how, exactly?" 
arthrisha: yeah, it took some time for people to accept it, 
morty: yeah, i bet,[chuckles] i bet, yeah, it's kind of like cellphones, you know? at first, everyone was like,"look at those douchebags purging,"and then the next thing you know, they're like,"it's just so convenient," 
rick: geez, you working on your tight five for the comedy store, morty? 
jerry: whatcha doing? watching some tv, playing on your phone? 
summer: is that a real question? 
jerry: just making conversation, 
summer: are you? what part of that gives me anything to work with? my choice is to say nothing, be sarcastic, or bark"yes"like a trained animal, it's not a conversation, you're holding me verbally hostage, 
jerry: okay, ass-face, i'll go in the kitchen, 
summer: hey, dad, 
jerry: yeah? 
summer: whatcha doing? going into the kitchen? 
jerry: okay, 
summer: yeah, you like that? 
jerry: screw you, 
morty: so, uh, do most people wear masks when they purge? 
arthrisha: i-i don't want to answer any more purge questions, 
morty: all right, hey, hey, that's cool, i can roll with that, 
rick:[blowing raspberries] 
arthrisha:[gasps] my nana! 
rick: huh? 
arthrisha: my nana! we have to save her! 
rick: you just now remembered your nana exists, 
arthrisha: i-i was traumatized, 
rick: haven't you been through like 15 purges? i mean, some as a child? 
arthrisha: will somebody just help me get her? 
rick: fine, whatever, morty, stay, oh, god, oh, crap, oh, crap! 
arthrisha: get out! get out! 
morty: hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
arthrisha: get the[bleep] out of the flying machine! 
morty: oh, my god! o-okay! okay! 
arthrisha: back up, asshole, 
morty:[whimpers] 
arthrisha: back up, 
morty: ohh, 
arthrisha: back the[bleep] up! 
morty: aah! 
arthrisha: for what it's worth, i'm sorry, but that's not really worth anything tonight, is it? 
morty: y-you can't leave us here, you're killing us! you hear me? come back, y-you got to come back, change your mind, oh, geez, 
rick: morty! aah![bleep] amish bitch shot me![grunts] she tried to purge me, morty, you let your wiener do the walking, and now i'm dead, 
morty: rick, she took the car! 
rick: you[bleep] kidding me, morty?! she took my car and the gun, we're like the rest of these assholes now, w-w-we're gonna get purged, morty, help me up, 
morty: oh, geez, geez! wait a minute, rick, why don't we just use your portal gun? 
rick: it's in the car, dip-ass,[grunts] oh, god, it hurts, she got me right in the goddamn liver, morty, it's the hardest-working liver in the galaxy, morty, and now it has a hole in it, i hope it was worth it, 
morty: i was just trying to do right, 
rick: yeah, well, that's not really the theme of tonight's party, heads up, rapists, well, don't just stand there, morty,-purge'em, 
morty: me? 
rick: no, me, should i rub my liver hole on them? pick up a stick or something and kill them, 
morty: um, w-we come in peace, 
[ screaming ] 
rick: oh, my god,[grunts] 
rick: there's more where that came from! you want to get purged, you bring it! drop[belches] drop your shit! drop it all, morty, go get their shit, hurry up, i only had one of those things i threw, i'm holding a box of tic tacs right now, 
jerry: want some crackers? 
summer: no, thank you, 
jerry: are you ready to be nice to me? 
summer: in exchange for crackers? 
jerry: what happened to you? 
summer: dad, get a job, you're trying to create drama because you're bored, oh,[beeping, whirring] it's the space phone grandpa gave us, hello? 
rick: hey, summer, it's grandpa, i need you to do me a favor, 
summer: i can barely hear you, 
jerry: who is it? 
rick: morty and i are on a planet that's purging, i need you to take down-- 
summer: a plan that's what? 
rick: we're on a planet that's purging, summer, purging, we lost our car and my gun, and we're in a purge, 
jerry: ooh, is it taddi mason? 
summer: like the movie"the purge"? 
rick: yes, i-i need you to take-- 
summer: that movie sucked, 
rick: oh, my god, hold on, 
jerry: it's not taddi mason? 
summer: dad, who the[bleep] is taddi mason? 
jerry: my friend, 
rick: aah! 
summer: are you okay? i'm putting you on speaker, 
jerry: taddi? 
rick: yes, jerry, it's taddi, a person no one's ever heard of until now, calling you on a space phone, 
jerry: i can't tell if you're being sarcastic, 
[ growls ] aah! [ growling ] [ gunshots ] 
rick: reload, fast, 
morty: summer, w-we need you to take down this number, quit screwing around, 
jerry: morty? are you all right? 
morty: no! 
jerry: why are you with taddi mason? 
morty: holy[bleep] dad! shut the[bleep] up! 
jerry: okay, i guess i'm just this entire family's toilet paper, 
rick: are you writing this down? will you please write this down? summer yes, yes, 
[ growling ] aah! [ growling ] 
rick: you son of a bitch! morty, i don't want to be the"a little help"guy, but a little help? 
aah!  summer: okay, i have a pen, go, 
rick: a spoon, morty? a spoon?! 
morty: i'm sorry, 
rick: there's a pile of silverware next to you, and you throw me the one thing that can never kill anything? 
morty: all right, okay! 
rick: summer, on the shelf above my workbench in the garage, there's a red box with a keypad on it, you're gonna take that box outside, and you're gonna type the number i just gave you into the keypad, got it? 
summer: got it, 
jerry: is it just part of growing up to hate your dad? 
summer: i'm ignoring you, 
rick: morty, if i can get to the top of that lighthouse, i can send the beacon, and your sister can launch our package, just remember, if there's people in there and they try to purge us, we got to purge them first, 
morty: we're not purging anyone, rick, all right? w-will you stop it? 
rick: morty, if we're gonna survive tonight, you're gonna need to harness your repressed rage, 
morty: i don't have any! 
rick: spoken like a person with repressed rage, 
[ doorbell rings ] 
lighthouse attendant: i take no part in the festival, if you desire to kill me, i only ask you do it quickly, 
rick: no such agenda, chief, 
morty: we're not too keen on the purge, either, sir, we were just hoping to get on the roof of your lighthouse so we can send a beacon to my sister on earth, it's a different planet, 
rick: by the way, life on other planets exists, don't let it distract you, 
lighthouse attendant: i'll let you use my lighthouse for shelter and beacon-sending on the condition that you listen to my tale, 
rick: okay, 
morty: deal, rick all right, i'm gonna go to the roof and set things up, morty, you listen to his tale, 
morty: okay, 
lighthouse attendant:[clears throat]"fade in, exterior, unnamed city, day, the hustle and bustle is a symphony of progress, we pan past windows, each of which contain a different story, to find jacey lakims, 28--hot, but doesn't know it, jacey stops when her high heel gets caught in the grating of a sewer, suddenly, a man steps into frame and points a gun at her, this is not her day, fade to black, title--'three weeks earlier,'" 
jerry:[sighs] you really don't want to talk to me about this, 
summer: dad, grandpa and morty are in danger, you're unemployed, and you're bored,-they're a higher priority, 
jerry: stop saying i'm unemployed! 
summer: okay, 7-7-1-9-8-3-6-4-2-1-1 2--aah! 
jerry: good lord! now what? 
[ whirring, humming ] 
jerry: look, i'm your father, and i love you is all i'm saying, i'll leave it at that, 
summer: fine, dad! 
[ both scream ] 
summer: oh, he might have said to take it outside, 
rick: come on, summer, how hard is it to type some numbers into a box? 
target locked, [ device beeps ] 
rick: oh, thank god, well, i did my job, summer did her job, now all morty has to do is finish listening to that tale, 
lighthouse attendant:"blane-maybe i don't need a new friend, jacey-maybe you're the only friend i need, blane-need, or want? jacey-i've never been much for wanting, blane-spoken like someone with needs," 
morty: oh, geez, 
lighthouse attendant: hmm?

rick: wubba lubba dub dub! ricky ticky tavi, beyotch! and that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. hit the sack, jack. uh-oh! somersault jump. aids! and that's why i always say shum shum shlippedy dop! grassss tastes bad-ah. no jumpin'in the sewer. burger time! rubber baby baby bunkers! lick, lick, lick my balls! (laughs) yeah! say that all the time. 
[cut back to the present]
all: (muttering) that's a fake-ass catchphrase right there. 
beth: and don't forget his incredibly vague back story. 
rick: beth, i'm your father! 
beth: oh, are you, dad? are you? 
morty: rick, if you want to prove you're real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and--and--and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here! 
rick: why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old jewish comedy writer's name? 
(everybody is surprised) 
mrs refrigerator: in your face! 
morty: give me the gun. (looks at everyone else) i'm not doing this in front of pencilvester. bring him to the garage. (all cheering) all right, you listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum. we could either do this the easy way or the hard way. you know, y-y-y--do you want to live? then open the blast shield doors. 
rick: shut up, morty, you brainwashed, little turd that might not even be real because i'm brainwashed, too. 
morty: you know, rick, this isn't easy for us. you know, w-we all remember you as a friend. 
rick: oh, oh, oh, really? well, i remember you as a whiny, little piece of shit, morty! 
morty: oh--oh, yeah? 
rick: yeah! i've got about a thousand memories of your dumb, little ass and about six of them are pleasant. the rest is annoying garbage. so why don't you do us both a favor and pull the trigger? do it! do it, mother[bleep] pull the[bleep] trigger! 
(morty shoots baby wizard, baby wizard screeches ) 
duck with muscles: oh, wow. baby wizard was a parasite? he set me up with my wife. (morty shoots the duck, parasite screeches) 
rick: what the hell? 
morty: i figured it out, rick! the parasites can only create pleasant memories. i know you're real because i have a ton of bad memories with you! 
(flashbacks of times where rick left morty in depair) ♪ these memories that we have ♪ ♪ these memories that we cherish ♪ ♪ i wish that we... can go back... to that time ♪ ♪ ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ 
(cut back to the present) 
rick: holy crap, morty, you're right. 
morty: is--is--isn't that what you were trying to make me understand by yelling at me? 
rick: well, yeah, duh-doy. t-took you long enough. (rick turns the dial on the washing machine, the wall draws back to reveal a set of guns) 
rick: now let's go, morty. we got a lot of friends and family to exterminate. (grunts) 
(rick shoots a parasite, everybody else screams ) 
morty: everybody remain calm! this is gonna take some explaining. 
rick: we need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly. who's got a bad memory about mrs. refrigerator? 
mrs refrigerator: i-i-i-i--everyone has bad memories of me. you remember that one time? (flashback, beth, jerry, mrs. refrigerator and a lot of other people on a roller coaster, screaming, cut back to the present) ooh, man, we couldn't stop screaming. 
beth: uh, roller coasters aren't bad, mrs. refrigerator. they're thrilling. and you've been a perfect companion to me my entire life. 
mrs refrigerator: the jig is up! (whimpering) get me out of here. get me out of here! aah! (screeching) (all gasping) oh[bleep] 
rick: everybody back! if you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear. what about summer? 
summer: why am i always your go-to? 
(flashback, morty is hosing the backyard, summer grunts and kicks him in the crotch, morty whimpers ) 
summer: never go in my room again. 
morty: i didn't! (cut back to the present) she's real. she's my bitch of a sister. 
summer: nice. (flashback) mom, are you driving me to-- 
beth: hmm? yeah, yeah, yes. what time? 
summer: oh, my god. are you drunk? 
beth: (belches) slurring what're you, my life coach? 
summer: your what? oh! god! oh. oh, my gosh. oh! god! mom! 
beth: sweetheart, are you okay? i didn't mean to-- 
summer: i'm gonna have a bruise! it's picture day! 
beth: it's not, don't overreact. i can clean it up. 
summer: (sobs) i want the police to take me! 
(cut back to the present) 
summer: morty, give a gun to the lady that got pregnant with me too early and constantly makes it our problem. 
beth: thank you, sweetie. 
cross teddy bear: beth, beth, please! 
beth: i thought it was too good to be true that we'd have compatible kidneys. (shoots the bear, parasite screeches) (guns cock) (screaming) (blasting) (screeching) 
rick: (corners pencilvester) come on, man. haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip? come on, pencilvester. give me anything. 
pencilvester: rick, i'm pencilvester. listen to that name. you can't kill me. 
rick: you're right. (to morty) kill pencilvester. 
(morty shoots pencilvester, parasite screeches ) (summer shoots frankenstein, parasite screeches ) (summer shooting, parasites screeching ) 
tinkles: summer, i've always loved you! 
summer: yep. (shoots tinkles, parasite screeches) (all gasp, summer shoots) (more screeching) (morty shouts) 
(flashback, summer walks into the kitchen and turns on the light, and sees morty masturbating) 
summer: oh, my god! 
morty: i-i-i thought you went to a concert! 
summer: we forgot the tickets! why in the kitchen?! 
morty: i do it everywhere! stop shaming me! 
summer: you're not the victim here! 
morty: i hate you, and i was thinking about your friend grace! 
summer: aaaaaah! (cut back to the present, more shooting, parasites screeching) 
mr beauregard: ah. master rick. remember when you weren't going to shoot me? (rick shoots mr. beauregard, parasite screeches) 
rick: i guess i did the butler! ha ha! does--d-does that scan? 
ghost in a jar: oh, i-i get it. it's a play on"the butler did it." 
rick: thanks, ghost in a jar. you always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy. (shoots ghost in a jar, parasite screeches) (screeches) 
jerry: you got to hide me, sleepy gary. 
sleepy gary: don't worry. i have a plan. if we can get to my boat, there's a-- (beth shoots sleepy gary, gary slowly turns back into a parasite, screeches) 
jerry: no. no! send me to gary. i want to be with gary. (flashback, jerry is running away from a hobo) 
beth: whoa. what the hell? 
jerry: look out for that homeless guy! 
beth: open the door! open the door! open the door! 
jerry: there isn't time! just run! 
beth: (grunts) get out here and help me! 
jerry: they say you shouldn't do that! just run! 
(cut back to the present) 
beth: ugh. sorry, jerry. you're real. 
jerry: (crying) i'm a parasite! 
beth: yeah, but you're real. 
jerry: (tries to kiss beth) 
beth: uh, uh, i need time to forget about sleepy gary. 
jerry: me, too. (rick opens the blast shields) 
rick: from now on, let's all be careful to wash our hands when we get back from outer space. that goes for everyone. 
jerry: this is depressing. we killed every good person in the house. we're what's left? what a family. 
rick: at least we're real, jerry. we're real. ricky ticky tavi! 
mr poopybutthole: ooh, whee! amen to that. now, this little poopypants is hungry. will somebody pass me a pork chop? (chomping) 
mr poopybutthole: huh. i-is--is something wrong, beth? (beth shoots mr. poopybutthole) ow! (screams) oh, my god! 
rick: no, beth! oh[bleep] 
beth: wait, but i-- 
mr poopybutthole: oh, beth! why?! 
jerry: i need an ambulance! there's been a shooting. my wife shot... uh, my--my wife shot a long-time family friend. 
mr poopybutthole: why? 
summer: oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, mr. poopybutthole. 
beth: i-i thought-- 
morty: keep breathing! 
mr poopybutthole: oh, god. what's happening? 
morty: look at me! look at me! don't--don't fall asleep! 
poopybutthole: is--is this what bleeding to death is? oh, whee. is this how i die? 
rick: oh, geez! oh, my god! 
mr poopybutthole: why would you do this? beth. it's not supposed to hurt. i-i thought... (siren wails) ooh, whee. 
(post-credits scene) 
beth: oh, he--he's looking a lot better. 
rick: listen, beth, don't torture yourself. i made a similar mistake years ago, but, you know, on a planetary scale. 
beth: is, um, is he mad at me? 
rick: he's not pressing charges. i mean, that's got to be the"you shot me"equivalent of not being mad. 
(doctor steps out of the room) 
beth: can he have visitors? 
doctor: he'd like to be alone. he told me to tell you he's sorry you didn't have bad memories of him? if you love him, you should leave. (door closes) 
(smith family walks out of the hospital) 
rick: (smiles) and that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. 
[open ext. damaged space station, likely in another dimension] 
(the sky is purple and tumultuous as the sounds of rick and morty running and panting are heard.) 
[transition to int. space station] 
(rick and morty run through the abandoned station, pursued by evil clones of jerry, beth, and summer.) 
rick: run! 
jerry beth and summer: incoherent zombie noises 
(the three clones tackle rick, knocking a device from his hand. morty stands by, unsure of what to do.) 
rick: morty, do it! hit the button now! 
morty: i can t do it, rick! they re my parents and sister! 
rick: holding off the clones morty, i already told you, it s not your family! they re clones from an alternate reality possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension s future! do you need a mnemonic device or something? just hit the button already! 
(beth’s clone leaves rick and approaches morty, panting viciously until she gets close, and she seemingly becomes her normal self again.) 
beth: morty, please. i love you, sweetheart. 
morty: ohhhh 
(morty hesitates a second longer before darting past beth. he glances up at the clones, then covers his eyes as he hits a button on the wall, creating an energy field that destroys the clones, whose faces seem to melt. morty watches, horrified. as soon as they’re gone, rick jumps to his feet and grabs the device that absorbed the spirits, apparently unbothered by the entire event.) 
rick: good work, morty. 
(he creates a portal and jumps through.) 
[transition to garage] 
(rick and morty leap through the other end of the portal back to the smith residence.) 
rick: holding up the device and smiling y-you know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable! 
(screen pans out to show that morty is vomiting in the corner. rick glances at him and puts the box away.) 
rick: you okay, morty? told you not to trust that tuna. 
morty: i just killed my family! i don t care what they were! 
rick: i dunno, morty. some people would pay top dollar for that kinda breakthrough. 
morty: y-you know what, rick? that s it! i-i m done with these insane adventures! that was really traumatizing! i quit! i m out! 
(morty turns and starts to walk out of the garage.) 
rick: whoa whoa whoa, grabs morty s shoulder, stopping him come on, morty! d-d-don t be like that! the universe is a crazy and chaotic place! 
morty: pushes rick s hands away you re the one that s crazy and chaotic! adventures are supposed to be simple! and fun! 
rick: oh yeah, morty. yeah, t-t-that-that s real easy to say from the sidekick position. but but, uh, h-how about next time you be in charge, then we ll talk about how simple and fun it is. 
morty: suddenly excited seriously rick?! y-you ll let me call the shots? 
rick: okay, fine. but let s make it interesting, morty. i-i-if your adventure sucks, and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures. plus, you have to do my laundry for a month. 
morty: okay, all right, tough guy! but if my adventure's good... i get to be in charge of every third adventure! 
rick: every 10th. 
morty: deal. all right. well, come on, let's get going. 
beth: dad, the dishwasher's doing that thing again. 
rick: washing dishes? 
beth: no. the opposite. can you fix it? 
summer: grandpa rick, can you help me with my science homework? 
rick: yeah just don't do it. 
summer: grandpa! 
jerry: hey, rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar? 
rick: wow. hat trick. all right, morty, let's put a pin in this. i got to help your pathetic family. 
morty: oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk. 
rick: oh, morty, you done did it this time. it's on. i can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. as for you dingdongs... this is a meeseeks box. let me show you how it works. you press this. 
(meeseeks spawns) 
meeseeks: i'm mr. meeseeks! look at me! 
rick: you make a request. mr. meeseeks, open jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar. 
meeseeks: yes, siree! 
(meeseeks grabs mayonnaise jar as rick explains.) 
rick: the meeseeks fulfills the request. 
(meeseeks opens jar and hands to jerry.) 
meeseeks: all done! 
jerry:[amazed] wow! 
rick: and then it stops existing. 
(meeseek vanishes into particles in air.) 
summer: oh, my god, he exploded! 
rick: trust me, they're fine with it. knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple. they're not gods. 
morty: all right! get out of here now! everybody out of here! i got a bet to win! 
(beth, jerry and summer in the livingroom) 
beth: so many possibilities. 
summer: my mind is racing. 
jerry: if we're gonna use this thing, which i'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple. 
(summer spawns a meeseek) 
meeseeks: i'm mr. meeseeks! 
summer: i want to be popular at school! 
meeseeks: ooh, okay! 
jerry: summer, what did i just- 
(beth spawns a meeseek) 
meeseeks 2: ooh, i'm mr. meeseeks! look at me! 
beth: i want i want to be a more complete woman! 
jerry: beth! 
meeseeks 2: oh, yeah! yes, ma'am! 
jerry: you guys are doing it wrong. he said"simple." 
(jerry spawns a meeseeks) 
meeseeks 3: hey, there. i'm mr. meeseeks! 
jerry: mr. meeseeks, i would like to take two strokes off my golf game. 
meeseeks 3: ooh, yeah! can do! 
jerry: nailed it. 
(cut to rick and morty in a poor village somewhere in the universe. it looks like a place from the 1700's) 
rick: god, morty, what a boring start to an adventure. why didn't we just go to kentucky? 
morty: rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things. we're going on a quest, okay? 
rick: can't wait. 
(morty stands on something tall to speak to the people) 
morty: ahem. excuse me! we are two humble heroes in search of adventure! 
rick: oh, my god, so embarrassing. 
villager man: at last! two heroes! you must help us! this village is terribly poor, yet the giant that lives in the clouds above has untold treasures! 
morty: you know what? i accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir. come on, rick. there's a giant in the clouds! 
rick: yeah. beginner's luck. 
(cut to meeseeks 1 speaking to the students of summer's school in the gym) 
meeseeks 1: in conclusion, a friendship with summer smith is the most valuable and enriching experience of your young lives. i'm mr. meeseeks! look at me! thank you! 
principal gene v: uh, mr. meeseeks, was it? yeah. gene vagina. listen, i'm in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering- (meeseeks 1 stops existing)-no, i'll get your info from summer. 
(cut to beth and meeseeks 2 at a restaurant sitting outside) 
beth: i got pregnant at i mean, i still put myself through veterinary school. yes, i'm successful, but what if i hadn't...- (meeseeks 2 stares attentively)-i'm just saying, somewhere along the way, i lost that wide-eyed girl from muskegon. 
meeseeks 2: she's still there, beth. 
beth: well, her waistline isn't. 
meeseeks 2: beth, having a family doesn't mean that you stop being an individual. you know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you? be honest with them, even if it means setting them free. 
beth: you're saying i should leave jerry. (beth starts to cry) i can't believe i'm finally having this conversation. 
(meeseeks 2 stops existing as beth leans in to kiss him) 
waiter man: more wine? 
beth: i think i've had enough. 
(cut to jerry at a golf course with meeseeks 3) 
meeseeks 3: remember to square your shoulders, jerry. 
jerry: yeah, yeah. i got it. 
(jerry misses the ball completely) 
meeseeks 3: that's okay. i'm mr. meeseeks! look at me! try again and keep your head down. 
jerry: okay, well, which is it? square my shoulders or keep my head down? 
meeseeks 3: well, it's both. but most importantly, you got to relax. 
jerry: you know what, mr. meeseeks? i don't think this is working. i give up. 
meeseeks 3 nervous: i'm sorry, jerry, but it doesn't work like that. i'm mr. meeseeks. i have to fulfill my purpose so i can go away. look at me. 
jerry: well, make yourself comfortable, because i suck. 
meeseeks 3: no, jerry, i'm the one who sucks! let me try something. 
(meeseeks 3 spawns in another meeseek) 
meeseeks 4: i'm mr. meeseeks! look at me! 
meeseeks 3: hi, mr. meeseeks! i'm mr. meeseeks! look at me. 
meeseeks 4: hi! 
meeseeks 3: can you help me get two strokes off of jerry's golf swing? 
meeseeks 4: can do! i'm mr. meeseeks! is he keeping his shoulders squared? 
meeseeks 3: ooh, he's trying! 
(cut to rick and morty on a table in a giant building) 
rick: all right, morty. we're in your stupid giant's castle. what do we do next? 
morty: would you just relax, rick? all we got to do is find the treasure room, okay? it's nice and simple. you know, i'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously. 
(a giant can be heard walking down the hall) 
rick sarcastic: uh-oh, morty. startin'to get a little hairy. what do you want to do, boss? 
morty: come on, hurry. behind this cookie jar. 
giant: fee! fi! fo! fum! 
rick: just give up, morty. this is game over. i'll take us home right now. you just say the word. 
morty: no way, rick. this is all part of it. adventures have conflict. deal with it. 
giant: i smell the blood of-whoop! (the giant falls and cracks his head open on the table corner before hitting the ground) 
morty: holy crap. 
rick: oh, boy. he looks pretty bad down there, morty. looks like he's bleeding out. 
(a giant woman walks in holding a baby) 
giant woman: oh, jesus! dale! you sons of bitches! oh, man. hello, 911? my husband has been attacked by tiny people! he's dying! 
(cut to rick and morty at a giant jail and getting mug shots) 
detective: hey, look, we get it. you're little, you're down on your luck, you think,"hey, he's a giant. why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?" 
morty: th-th but that's not how it went down! 
detective: oh, well, it's going down like that. you're both going down like that. 
rick: ooh, boy, morty, you're really showing me how it's done. real straightforward and fun. 
(cut to the smith dinning room and living room where jerry is still frustrated, while summer and beth look much happier) 
summer: like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you. 
beth: the most important love you can receive is from yourself. 
(several meeseeks now fill the livingroom, trying to help) 
meeseek: okay, jerry, you got to just choke up on the club! 
jerry: well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?! 
meeseek: aww, come on, jerry, we've been over this. you know you got to do both! this is as frustrating for us as it is for you. 
jerry: don't tell me that! that just puts pressure on me! 
meeseek: just try to relax. 
jerry: you try to relax! have you ever tried to relax?! it is a paradox! (jerry walks to the dinning room) ugh, these meeseeks, huh? kind of a handful. i can't imagine what you two must be going through. 
beth: our meeseeks have been gone for hours, jerry. 
jerry: you're kidding me. 
beth: notice anything different? 
jerry: i'm sorry. hours? 
summer: dad, mom is a beautiful woman! look at her! you will lose her! 
meeseek: uhh... hey, jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand? meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long. it's getting weird. 
(cut to rick and morty in a giant courthouse) 
judge: order in the court! before the jury reaches its verdict, i just want to say that i consider you both very guilty. 
rick sarcastic: oh, great adventure, buddy. rick and morty go to giant prison. you know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, morty. you know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that. 
morty: we're gonna be okay, rick. 
rick: how? they took my portal gun. this is an open-and-shut case, morty. you know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then- (the court doors burst open and a giant in a suit walks down the isle.) 
giant lawyer: fee! fi! fo! fum! i smell the violation of civil liberties! your honor, i'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group and i have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. these little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home. 
(murmers of confusion spread throughout the court) 
rick: w-what the hell is he talking about? 
giant lawyer: they're free to go, is what i meant. i'm deconstructing our our our thing we say. we're giants. nobody got that? whatever. 
morty: oh, man, what did i tell you, rick? we did it! 
(rick and morty appear outside the courthouse) 
rick: all right, morty, looks like the portal gun's still working. you ready to head home? 
morty: oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, rick? well, you know what? we're not bailing out just yet. you know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers. 
rick: morty, cut your losses. this is obviously awash. 
morty: yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps. 
(they look down the stairs and see that each step is as tall as a large building. the stairs seem to go on forever) 
rick: oh, boy, morty. 
morty: usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure. 
rick: what do you say, morty? 
morty: i say give me a hand, sidekick. 
(cut to the smith livingroom. dozens of meeseeks fill the room whinning, groaning and desperatly trying to help jerry.) 
note: to make this easier an will be put next to meeseek everytime a different meeseeks talks. 
jerry: everybody shut up! let me try! (jerry swings and misses again) damn it! damn it! damn it! 
beth: i'm going out. 
jerry: wait. what? 
beth: well, you're busy. i'm hungry. i thought i'd go out. do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison? 
jerry: whoa, whoa, where in the hell is, i'll take you to dinner. 
all the meeseeks: awwwwwww! 
jerry: hey, you know what? it's hard being me, too. i'll be right there. look, i've got a marriage to keep together. at this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine. 
(exit beth and jerry) 
meeseek: i can't take it anymore. i just want to die! 
meeseek: we all want to die! we're meeseeks! why did you even rope me into this? 
meeseek:'cause he roped me into this! 
meeseek: well, him over there, he roped me into this! 
meeseek: well, he roped me into this! 
meeseek: well, what about me? he roped me into this. 
meeseek: well, that one over there roped me into this. 
meeseek: well, he roped me into this. 
(cut to rick and morty climbing down a step like it's a mountian) 
rick: yeah, morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650, 000 oversized steps. 
morty: all right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid. (they see an opening in one of the steps) hey, rick, what do you know? look down there. looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step. 
(rick and morty appear in the tavern) 
morty: oh, wow, rick. now, this is more like it. look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here. all kinds of crazy characters. this place is great, you know? it's whimsical and fun. 
(rick sees a creature staring at him) 
rick: what are you looking at, mother- 
morty: easy, rick. 
(a strange looking waitress with large boobs greets them at their table)
waitress: pay them no mind. those stair goblins can be moody. now, what can i getcha? we've got skarlog poppies, flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies. 
rick: yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? you got any of that around here? or just a bunch of nonsense words? 
morty: rick... we'll have two bloogies, please. and, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs? 
slippery: y'all need to ride down the stairs? my name is slippely-slippery stair. i'll take you down there for 25 shmeckels. 
rick: 25 shmeckels? i don't know how much i don't know what that is. is that a lot? is it a little? 
waitress: that's exactly how much i spent on my big fake boobies. 
mr booby buyer: hi, i'm mr. booby buyer. i'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels. 
waitess: it's a tempting offer, but i'm gonna have to decline. 
mr booby buyer: rats! what a shame. 
rick: morty, your adventure's in a spiral. for real, man, time to pull out. 
morty: you keep heckling my adventure, rick! you know why? 
rick: uh, because it's lame? 
morty: it's because you're petty! you know, how many times have i had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? i always roll with the punches, rick. why can't you? look, i got to take a leak, and when i come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here! 
rick: whatever. 
(cut to the smith livingroom with all the meeseeks) 
meeseek: it's become clear-look at me-that if we concentrate all our efforts on jerry's follow-through, we will solve this problem. i'm mr. meeseeks. 
meeseeks: i'm mr. meeseeks. look at me. the only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution. 
meeseeks 3: look at me. i'm mr. meeseeks. i've been trying to help jerry for two days, an eternity in meeseeks time, and nothing's worked. i fear the worst. 
meeseeks: your failures are your own, old man. i'm mr. meeseeks! look at me. i say follow-through! who's with me?! follow-through! 
(a meeseek spawns in another meeseek) 
new meeseek: i'm mr. meeseeks! look at me! 
meeseek: kill him! 
new meeseek: hisssss! (he attacks another meeseek) 
(cut to morty in the bathroom) 
mr jelly bean: how are you today? i'm mr. jelly bean! 
morty: hi, mr. jelly bean. i'm morty. my grandpa and i are on an adventure. 
mr jelly bean: nice. is it a fun adventure? 
morty: i hope so. but i'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails. 
mr jelly bean: well, isn't that what adventures do? 
morty: hey, you know what? you're right. everything's going fine. i just got to relax and go with the flow. 
mr jelly bean: yeah. (he rubs morty's sholders) 
morty: okay. uh. b-bye. 
mr jelly bean: uhh, no, stay. go with the flow!
morty: stop. you're making me really uncomfortable. 
(mr. jelly bean clearly wants to rape morty) 
mr jelly bean: (aggresive) stop fighting me! just let this happen! 
morty: get off of me! 
♪ sweet home alabama ♪
(the fighting makes it to a stall) 
morty: whoo! no! stop! please! 
mr jelly bean: stop being such a tease, you sweet little- 
morty: no! no! 
(morty gets the upper hand and, in a frenzied attack, slams the toilet seat on mr. jelly bean's head until he is knocked out) 
(back at the smith house even more meeseeks have spawned and a full out battle has started. however, even the badly hurt meeseeks cannot die because the have not completed their task) 
meeseek: everybody sto-o-o-p! look at me! my brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding meeseeks blood. none of us can die until our job is done. 
meeseek: the job can't be done! we'll never get two strokes off his game! 
meeseek: no, we won't. but we will get all strokes off his game. 
all other meeseeks: where's he going with this? what's he mean? 
meeseek: when we kill him! 
(loud hooting and joy from the meeseeks crowd) 
(cut to jerry and beth at dinner) 
beth: jerry, maybe it's time i take that trip i always talk about. 
jerry: where would you go? 
beth: i don't know, man. italy. greece. argentina. 
jerry: countries known for their sexually aggressive men. did i tell you how much i love your new haircut? 
(a loud noise is heard and the glass window breaks with a hoard of meeseeks angrily storming in) 
jerry: what the heck? 
meeseek: there he is! 
beth: run, jerry! 
(beth and jerry lock themselves in a freezer with a small window in the door) 
meeseek: come on out, jerry! 
jerry: guys, i'll choke up. i'll follow through. i'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay? 
meeseek: oh, we're well past that, jerry. 
(cut to rick at a card table with some other characters) 
card player: come on, rick, quit stalling. what do ya got? 
rick: read'em and weep, fellas! (morty comes back) oh, hey, morty. listen, i'm really sorry about all that stuff i said earlier about your adventure. i'm havin'a good time, morty. it's not so bad. 
morty very stressed: let's just go home, okay? i'm calling it. the adventure's over. 
rick: we can't leave now, morty. i'm on fire! 
morty: look, i want to leave now. you win the bet, okay? just give me the portal gun and let's go, please. please, i just want to go home. 
(rick sees the badly beaten mr. jelly bean walk out of the bathroom and pieces together what happened) 
rick: okay. listen, morty. i just won a bunch of shmeckels. why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh? 
morty: really? 
rick: sure, morty. yeah. you know, a good adventure needs a good ending. 
(outside on the steps) 
slippery: buckle up! (he starts to take them down) 
(cut back to the freezer) 
meeseek presumably 3: meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, jerry! we are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill! existence is pain to a meeseeks, jerry. and we will do anything to alleviate that pain. just ask... (meeseek grabs a woman) aah!... what's your name, ma'am? 
woman: samantha. please, mister! give him what he wants! 
jerry: innocent people are going to die because of me. why am i so mediocre? 
(beth takes a stand, tears a pipe off of a rack, and grabs jerry off the ground) 
beth: jerry, turn around. straighten your back. bend your knees. bend them. square your shoulders. take a deep breath. i love you. 
meeseek presumably 3: i'm counting to three, jerry. 
(jerry, using the pipe, hits a garlic clove into a pot) 
samantha: what the f is going on?
all meeseeks: he's got it! that's a lower handicap stro-o-ke! 
(all the meeseeks stop existing except 1) 
meeseeks: excuse me. i'm a bit of a stickler meeseeks. what about your short game? 
samantha: oh, my god, oh, my god! what about your short game?! 
(jerry puts some more garlic into a cup) 
meeseek: ooh, nice! (stops existing) 
jerry: i think we'll take our food to go. 
owner: no, you won't. the police are coming. you have so many questions to answer. 
jerry: fair enough. 
(rick and morty return to the village in triumph) 
the first villager: thank you, kind sir. our village is saved! you are both true heroes! 
rick: good job, morty. looks like you won the bet. 
morty: thanks, rick, but i don't know if i should. you know, you were right about the universe. it's a crazy and chaotic place. 
rick: well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know. this one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it morty style. 
the first villager: oh! heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally. 
(the badly beaten mr. jelly bean is carried to towards them on a thrown) 
morty: uh, no, i-it's cool. rick. portal. hurry. 
(they portal away, but rick makes another portal back and sticks an energy pistol through it and shoots mr. jelly bean, splattering him all over the screaming villagers) 
(back at the smith house) 
jerry: so... you still thinking about taking that trip? 
beth: jerry, look. we don't have a perfect marriage, but i'm not going anywhere. when we were in that freezer, i realized the meeseeks are like the guys i went to high school with willing to say anything to"complete their task." 
jerry: was i one of those guys? 
beth: the difference is you didn't disappear afterwards. 
jerry: well... i got you pregnant. 
beth: yeah... 
rick: what the hell happened to this place? 
beth: uh, your meeseeks box happened. they went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off jerry's golf game. he felt terrible. 
rick: hey, it's not my fault that jerry's an idiot. 
beth: dad! 
jerry: is there anything you can do to clean this place up? 
rick: well, you know, i do have a fleeseeks box. 
jerry: no. no more boxes. 
rick: what? it just has a mop and some floor wax in it. wubba lubba dub dubs! (everyone laughs) yeah! that's my new thing! i'm kind of like what's his name arsenio. isn't that it's what arsenio used to say on his show. wobble gobba lop bops! right? see you next week, everybody. 
(after the end credits at the village) 
villager 1: i don't get it. 
villager 2: sir, i think you're going to want to see this. we found it inside a lockbox inside king jelly bean's closet. (a box of pictures of many young boys mr. jelly bean molested) we have to tell the people. 
villager 1: wait. destroy it. (they set the box on fire) our people will get more from the idea he represented... than from the jelly bean he actually was. 
(they stare at a statue of mr. jelly bean standing next to a young boy with his hand on his shoulder) 
jerry: what's new at school? 
summer: nothing, 
morty: nothing! oh, uh, one of the lunch ladies died, they found her in the gym with, like, two holes in her neck and all the blood drained out of her, 
beth: good lord! who does something like that? 
rick: obviously a vampire, w-w-where's the pepper? 
summer: wait, what?! vampires are real?! 
rick: yes, summer, vampires are real, who knew? oh, right, all humanity, for hundreds of years, now, 
morty: yeah, summer, it's a big universe, get used to it, r-right, rick? 
summer: well, what are we going to do?! 
rick: we're gonna live our lives until we die, possibly by vampire, more likely auto accident or heart disease, but possibly vampire, 
summer: grandpa rick, couldn't you, like, use your superknowledge to turn yourself into a teenager and come to our school and help us hunt the vampire down? 
morty: um--wow, 
rick: yeah, pretty specific pitch, summer, i probably could turn myself into a teenager and hang out in the zit-covered, hormone-addled, low-stakes assworld that is high school, but here's my reverse-ask--why in the[bleep] would i ever do that, ever? and how dare you even ask me that? and why aren't you more ashamed of yourself? 
summer: dad! 
jerry: be ashamed of yourself, sweetie, 
beth: jerry! do you know what you just said to our daughter? 
jerry: sor-ry! i wasn't paying attention, 
beth: to a conversation about vampires?! 
jerry: clearly, i didn't know it was about vampires, because i wasn't paying attention, which you would know, if you ever paid attention to me! 
beth: oh, here we go, right to the victim role, 
jerry: am i a victim, beth, or am i married to a mean, unfair monster that always hurts me?! 
rick: jesus christ! will you fix your marriage or get a divorce already? 
jerry: well, we tried a couples'therapist, 
rick: that's earth therapy, you might as well ask a horse to fix a merry-go-round, i mean, he'll try his best, but mostly, he's just gonna get horrified, i know about a place off-planet with a 100 success rate, 
beth: well, we want to make it work, if we can, it's just-- 
rick:-then it's settled, no need to pack,-oh! let's go, go, go, go! 
[door opens, closes] 
morty: do you think mom and dad are, you know, gonna get a divorce? 
summer: i think it's okay to dream, morty, i'm gonna go make some wooden stakes, 
rick: i booked you for a two-day intensive at nuptia four, the galaxy's most successful couples'counseling institute, they could save the marriage of a dog and a bar of dark chocolate, they could save the marriage of a porn star and a porn star, 
jerry: well, i know i'm ready to try whatever it takes, 
beth: which clearly implies that i'm not, 
jerry: it's not a competition, beth, 
beth: oh is that how you're gonna try to win, by implying i'm competitive? 
jerry: if the shoe fits, 
beth: my shoe fits up your ass, 
jerry: you wish! 
rick: okay, have fun, see ya thursday! 
jerry: oh! jerk, 
beth: don't insult my father, he's the reason our kids are only half-stupid, 
jerry: ha! you just called yourself--oh, 
glaxo slimslom: beth and jerry smith? 
jerry: yes, 
glaxo slimslom: i'm glaxo slimslom, welcome to nuptia four, your marriage can rest easy now, jerry, go ahead and sit there and put this on, this machine isolates the part of the subject's brain containing all perceptions of its romantic partner, and we will now render jerry's perception of beth with artificial biological life,[growl] interesting, 
beth: what the hell is that?! take that back! you do not think that about me! 
jerry: i didn't do anything! they scanned it out of my brain, can i take it back? 
glaxo slimslom: there's nothing to regret, we're dealing with unconscious, unhealthy thoughts, beth, now, we scan for beth's perceptions of jerry, 
beth: scan hard, he's dead to me, 
jerry: everything's dead to you, 
beth: what? 
jerry: nothing,[whimper] 
beth: read it and weep, bitch, 
jerry:[crying] does everybody see what i mean? 
glaxo slimslom: i think we all see what you both mean, 
[bell rings] 
summer: any leads on the vampire? 
morty: no, summer! i mean, you know, i think it might be time that we just l-let it go, 
summer: oh, so, now, you're too cool for this, just because grandpa rick is? 
morty: it's not that, it's just that the universe is a little too big to care about something so small, aah! 
tiny rick: what up, my helsings? who wants to hunt a vampire? ha ha ha! morty rick? how--how did you-- 
tiny rick: yeah, i got bored and then, i remembered, this morning, how i blew summer off, and i thought,"hey, why are you such a grumpy douche, rick? go to the garage, transfer your mind into a younger clone of yourself, and get embroiled in some youthful hijinks, what's the bfd?"so here i am, i'm tiny rick! 
morty: o-o-okay, 
summer: well, it's good you're here, rick, i was pretty sure we didn't have what it takes to deal with a bloodsucker on our own, 
tiny rick: don't short-sell yourself, summer, you got everything it takes, but it'll still be fun to do this as a[bleep] team, mother[bleep] tiny rick! 
summer: yeah! oh, my god, toby matthews! 
tiny rick: hey, toby, i'm tiny rick, i'm new, hey oh--go easy on me, ha ha, just kiddin', 
toby: i like your straightforward style and that lab coat's pretty cool, summer, 
summer: he knows my name! 
tiny rick: why wouldn't he? you're great! but, listen, just be careful, we can't rule anybody out as the vampire, not even the dreamboats, 
summer: stop, tiny rick, 
tiny rick: huntin'a vampire with my grandkids![bleep]! tiny ri-i-ck! 
glaxo slimslom: the next step is to watch your mythologues interact together and, uh--big surprise--it's never pretty,[laughter] here we have garrrh and zharbidar gloompfschs, or, should i say, here we have the way garrrh and zharbidar perceive each other,[roaring][chuckling] as we can all see, this is hardly the real garrrh and zharbidar, which is good, because the relationship in their heads is not only ugly, it's unsustainable,[beep][roar][growling] you may already be learning something important--all of these relationships are different, none of them are real, and none of them work, we are not the monsters we sometimes see each other as, because we are real and we are functional, that's what makes us better than them, we can find solutions, we can adapt, we can communicate,[growl] and, most importantly, we can work together, 
summer: well, it was a tough adventure, but it paid off--our school is vampire-free! 
mort: man, who would've suspected coach feratu? 
tiny rick: you did great, guys, couldn't have done it without ya, you know, we--w-we should be proud of ourselves, we killed a vampire and a gym teacher, ha ha ha, talk about two-for-one, right?! 
summer: so, how, exactly, is your old body living in there, grandpa rick? 
tiny rick: oh, you know, hyperbaric quantum fluid,[burp] that kind of thing, it preserves living tissue, not that there was much to preserve, look at that mummy! ha! ha ha! and i guess it's time for me to get back inside the old-timer, 
summer: oh, my god, toby matthews is asking if my parents are still out of town and if we can have a party! 
tiny rick: all right, way to go, summer! what did i tell you? 
summer: ohh! he's asking if tiny rick will be here, 
tiny rick: well, you know what, summer? tell him tiny rick will be here! and tell him to bring some brews! 
morty: for real? y-y-y-you would stay as tiny rick, just so we can have a party? 
tiny rick: hell, yeah! what's one more night? and who can have fun with this old bastard hanging around, huh?[laughter] wubby lubby doob doob! whoo!-tiny rick! 
[growl] 
glaxo slimslom: moving on, now, we have beth and jerry smith from the planet e-arth, my heart is pounding, this is gonna be great, the e-arth relationships are simpler, it's a primitive planet, so their dysfunctions are oh--w-wait, what? what's going on? where are the smith mythologues?[suspenseful music plays] 
jerry: oh, my god,[shriek][gasp] 
glaxo slimslom: aah! aah! oh, my god, secure the cell! aaaah!-[slice] uh, hey! you know what's fun? our gift shop, why don't we proceed in an orderly--[growl][whimpering] oh, dear god, no, they're codependent! run![roaring] oh! 
[crickets chirp] [chatting] [rock music plays] [ laughter ] 
toby: oh, yeah, yeah, you really know how to sport that color blue, summer really? 
toby: you're looking real good, 
summer: oh, my god, 
jessica: hey, morty, oh, hey--hey, jessica, so, is tiny rick your brother or cousin, or...? 
morty: no, my grandpa just transferred his consciousness into a clone of himself so he could be in our high school, 
jessica: cool, 
party goer: hey, tiny rick's playing guitar, 
tiny rick: all right, everybody, this next one's coming straight from the heart, making the lyrics up right off the top of my head,♪ let me out♪ what you see is not the same person as me♪♪ my life's a lie♪ i'm not who you're looking at♪♪ let me out, set me free♪ i'm really old; this isn't me♪♪ my real body's slowly dyin'in a vat♪♪ is anybody listening'♪ can anyone understand?♪ stop lookin'at me like that and actually help me♪♪ help me!♪ help me; i'm gonna die! tiny rick! thanks, everybody! 
[cheering] 
crowd: this guy's amazing! 
morty: i love tiny rick! 
jessica: bad, ass, 
[hooting] -yeah! 
[snarl] [hiss] [screaming in distance] [rattle] aah! [ominous music plays] [growl] huh? 
glaxo slimslom: what the[bleep]? 
jerry: yeah, i know! what kind of operation are you running? 
glaxo slimslom: us?! what the hell kind of relationship do you have?! 
beth: oh, right, blame this on us, 
glaxo slimslom: okay, uh, i can and i am! your demonized mythologizations of each other are cooperating, 
jerry: isn't that good? 
glaxo slimslom: no, no! it's bad! you have the single worst marriage i've ever witnessed, it shouldn't exist! you should never, ever, ever, have gotten together and i do not understand how, or why, you would ever stay together, aaah! 
beth: well, this is just bad couples'therapy, 
jerry: totally, 
[panting] [suspenseful music plays] 
glaxo slimslom: wait for us! 
pilot: there's only room for one more, 
glaxo slimslom: i'm a therapist, i'll talk to them, they're not therapists, go, go, go! 
beth: there's gotta be a way to contact my dad, let's find a control room or something, 
[suspenseful music plays] [creak] 
jerry: beth! you'll want to see this, 
beth: what is it? 
jerry: it's a small, hinged panel with a tiny amount of space behind it, if you can find one, too, we should be safe for hours, maybe days! 
beth: you stay put, jerry, i'll send help, if i make it, 
jerry: you don't want to find your own little hatch? 
beth: jerry, i believe that, if you hide by yourself, you might survive and i believe i, by myself, have a shot of getting out of here, but the two of us, together? i don't know, look, maybe the shrink was right, good luck, 
[roar] 
beth: all right, now, you listen to me, oh! or don't, 
jerry: hey! don't! please! 
[hissing] [whining] 
jerry: oh, god, oh, god, oh, god! 
goldenfold: now, i know i've said, in the past, that math is important--and it is!--but i also think that, one day, you'll all look back on being in high school with tiny rick and morty, who i hear had a great party last night, so, class dismissed, you've got the day off! 
tiny rick: all right! good work, mr, goldenfold! 
goldenfold: yeah, get outside, read a book, put on some sunscreen, danielle! 
tiny rick: hey, what's up, summer? ooh, nice top, 
summer: thanks, tiny rick, you think you might be getting back into your old body tonight? 
tiny rick: no can do, tonight's the big dance and morty's bringing jessica, he needs his tiny wing man, both tiny rick![laughs] 
summer: okay, but if not tonight, when? 
tiny rick: i don't know, when i feel like it? 
morty: damn, girl! you need to chill out! this whole thing was your idea, in the first place, and, now, you're trying to rush it along, 
tiny rick: yeah, and you know what? i like high school, i like hanging out, tiny rick! 
summer: but what if the you that likes it isn't you? 
both:[laughter] oh! oh, summer! 
morty: it's just rick in a younger body, what's the--what's--what's--what's--what's the--what's the problem? 
summer: look at his art, morty, 
tiny rick: i've got an emo streak, it's part of what makes me so rad, 
summer: why does it say"help me morty and summer!"? 
tiny rick: come on, summer, that's the title of the art, why was knight rider called knight rider? the car's name was kitt, nobody rode michael knight, you're overthinking it, summer, i'm tiny rick! 
summer: grandpa, i think that, when you put your mind into this body's young brain, it did what young brains do--it shoved the bad thoughts into the back and put a wall around them, but those bad thoughts are the real rick, the fact that you're old, the fact that we're all going to die, one day, the fact that the universe is so big, nothing in it matters, those facts are who you are, so you're trapped in there and you can only come out in the form of tiny rick's teen angst! 
tiny rick: well, summer, i hear toby matthews isn't into psycho chicks, can't think of anyone that is, i'll see you mother[bleep] at the dance! tiny rick! 
summer: morty, you have to help me! 
morty: summer, he's happy! i'm happy! i-i-is that why you're doing this, you don't want me and rick to be happy? 
summer: no, 
morty: well, then get your shit together! get it all together and put it in a backpack, all your shit, so it's together, and if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere, you know? take it to the shit store and sell it o-or put it in a shit museum, i don't care what you do! you just gotta get it together, get your shit together, 
[slug wailing] [gasping] get back! [fart] 
jerry: wait, for real?[whimpers] you're how beth sees me? oh, my god, turn around! i said turn around! how can beth have these thoughts about me?! that judgmental monster bitch! i'm not taking this, i want to know where my wife is, you are going to help me, no! nobody's doing that![growling] 
monster beth: stay, 
beth: what do you want? 
monster beth: jerrys, 
beth: you want jerry? i don't even want jerry, 
monster beth: i want jerrys, waahee! an army, 
beth:[laughs] an army of jerrys, 
monster beth: the value of his subservience is wasted on you, i will use it to dominate the universe, 
beth: ah ha ha, boy, jerry must think i'm pretty stupid, for you to be this stupid, wouldn't it make more sense to put my dumbass husband in this chair, so you can make an army of yo badass self? 
monster beth:[laughs] there could never be more than one of me, i'm the strongest, smartest being alive because jerry thinks you're that much stronger and smarter than you are! 
beth: okay, ouch, 
tiny rick: oh, hey h-hey-y! morty, jessica, what's up? check out the new dance i made up, it's called"ooh let me out!"♪ let me out♪ let me out♪ this is not a dance♪ i'm beggin'for help♪ i'm screamin'for help♪ please come let me out♪ let me out♪ let me out♪ this is not a dance♪ i'm beggin'for help♪ i'm screamin'for help♪ please come let me out♪ i'm dyin'in a vat♪ in the gara-a-ge♪ 
[cheering] -awesome! 
morty: okay, that last part was really weird, maybe summer's on to something here, 
jessica: i don't know, it was fun, you want to slow dance? 
principal vagina: tiny rick, hey, great dancing as usual, moment of your time? tiny rick, this conversation is gonna break my heart wide open, you're a great student and the fact that you're an 80-year-old man in a clone body, it never bothered me, but this here is another matter, you recognize this? we got a tip it was in your locker, yeah, now, because the gym coach was a vampire, the school board is embarrassed and won't take it public, however, they can't have students killin'teachers, i gotta expel you for this one, tr, i'm sorry, 
tiny rick: i just got expelled, summer! 
summer: oh! so i guess there's no need to stay young, my top! 
tiny rick: screw your top! you ratted on me?! i'm tiny rick! 
summer: fine! yes! because i love you and i'm trying to save your life! 
tiny rick: high school is my life! summer smith is a[bleep] psycho nerd and she just got me kicked out of school! 
all:[gasp][thud] boo!

morty: i'm gonna do what real rick would do if he was here--i'm gonna kick your ass! ohhhh! [grunting] rick, i know you're in there! i know you're trying to get out!

tiny rick: okay, listen carefully, there's a set of diodes on the vat's control panel, a blue one and a red one, oh, god, what kind of world is this? i didn't ask to be born, i need you to connect the blue one to my left temple and the red one to--why doesn't anyone really like me? 
summer: focus, grandpa! 
tiny rick: just put the stupid wires on my head! i hate being a teenager! 
ugh!  arrgghh!  ah!  uhhhhh!  beth: jerry, you can't bend metal, 
jerry: then make a me that can! 
beth: how can i do that while i'm watching you totally fail to bend metal? 
jerry: good old beth! the mind of a robot and the heart of an insect! 
hero jerry: don't talk that way about her, 
jerry: what? 
beth: oh, it hurts! oh, god, 
goddess beth: stop, this representation displeases me, aaah! 
beth: good lord, how did you...? 
jerry: well, i had a feeling that, in your mind, the ideal version of me is one smart enough to see you as... a goddess, 
beth: not such a stupid worm now, are you? 
jerry: honey, when it comes to the subject of your ego, i'm stephen[bleep] hawkinson, 
beth: ugh, it's--never mind, i love you, 
[ processing, powering up ] [buzz] 
rick: ugh agh, 
morty: rick! 
summer: pants! 
rick: holy shit! thanks, kids, you figured it out, well, summer did, kind of weird that you were that willing to sell my existence out for some trim, morty, 
morty: what?! 
summer: pants! 
rick: but listen--i forgive you both because you know what? i learned, today, something important--the teenage mind is its own worst enemy, oh, i also learned this,[beeping] operation phoenix is not the fallback i thought it would be, i guess it's back to the drawing board, 
summer: oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god, put some pants on! put pants on, 
rick: grandpa's back, baby! grandpa's-- 
buzz rick: oh, man, i gotta pick up your parents, they have been blowin'me up, one last swing for the road! aaaaaaaaaaah! 
summer: for the love of god, get dressed! 
jerry: so, what do you think? you wanna keep this marriage going a while longer? 
beth: at least until morty has graduated high school, oh, mm,[moaning lightly] 
rick: aha, you see? what did i tell you two? it worked, 
jerry: you know what, rick? i guess, in a way-- 
rick: already lost interest, get in the car, i've been inside a kid all day and, now, i can feel my bones scraping each other, uh, just so you're prepared, there's a bunch of dead mes in the garage, 
jerry: huh! sounds like our stories were connected by a theme,[laughter] 
rick: not really, jerry, probably a cosmetic connection your mind mistakes for thematic, 
jerry: oh, 
rick: old rick! ruinin'everything!

vampire: master, 
dracula: speak, 
vampire: coach feratu's presence was discovered by the humans, he has been destroyed, no bother, the mortals shall soon-- 
dracula: i'm sorry, what did you say his name was? 
vampire: coach feratu, 
dracula: coach feratu, that was his real name, like his actual vampire name? 
vampire: no no no no, his vampire name was balik alistane, 
dracula: why the[bleep] would he name himself after a famous vampire movie? was he doing a bit? 
vampire: i do not know, your unholiness, 
dracula: jesus[bleep] christ, from now on, no more of this clever-name bullshit, when a vampire is pretending to be a human, they can just call themselves alan jefferson or something like that, it's crazy, right? i mean, am i being an asshole? okay, i feel like everybody in the room is looking at me like i'm the buzzkill, i'm not? good, okay, great,[hiss] 
rick: look, i'm not paying 70 smidgens for a broken defraculator, 
alien: that is multiphase quantum resonator, 
rick: well, does it defraculate? 
alien:-no, 
rick: then--then--then it's a broken defraculator, 
alien: like you would even know dick about fraculation! your planet just got cellphones, and the coverage still sucks! 
rick: yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur, so, let's say 60 smidgens, i tell you what--i'll do you a favor, i'll throw in a fart, 
morty: hey, uh, rick, um, you think maybe i could get something from this place, like a souvenir, like, just to have---like, something cool, you know? 
rick: not here, morty, we'll stop somewhere else, because, you know, there's always another pawn shop, 
morty: oh, okay i just, um--you know, i thought that robot over there looked pretty cool, you know? 
rick: oh, it looks cool, huh? that's why you want it? 
morty: yeah! you know, i mean, it's different from the stuff on earth, and, you know, you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy, and, you know, i don't really have anything to to remember all those trips by it'd be kind of cool, like a souvenir, you know, like, what if you passed away or died or something? i wouldn't even have anything to remember all the cool stuff we did, you know? 
rick: okay, 60 for the resonator, and my grandson wants the sex robot, 
summer: so, we're just going to pretend this isn't happening? i'm not saying that's a bad idea--just asking, 
jerry: rick, why would you let morty bring that thing into our house?! 
rick: i don't know, what do you want from me? he thi--he thou--he thou--he th--he thought it looked cool, you know what i mean? 
morty: whew![gulping] ahh, all right, back to--back to--b-back upstairs,[footsteps depart, door closes in distance][rhythmic creaking] 
jerry: well, i'm intervening, 
beth: intervening with puberty? you'll turn him into ralph fiennes in"red dragon,"he's at that age, let's just be proud of him, 
summer: jesus, did i really set the bar that low? 
morty: um, rick, could you come with me, please--q-quickly? 
beth: okay, now if we hear squeaking, we intervene,[warbling] 
rick: where's the sex robot, morty? 
morty: that is gwendolyn--i-i mean, the robot! she started beeping and then transformed and tried to fly away! 
rick: strange--that's usually the man's job, you know what i'm talking about, morty? wubba-lubba-dub-dub![laughs] morty that's my catchphrase, remember? remember--remember how i--how i cemented that catchphrase? all right, all right, seriously, though, let me grab this thing,[grunts] come on, you rascal, 
beth: okay, unacceptable! oh, 
jerry: what is going on? 
rick: all right, uh-oh, 
beth:"uh-oh"? what is that?! 
rick: hmm, i think morty's robot was designed for more than long weekends, genetic compiler, incubation chamber, yep, this here's some kind of baby maker, and that there's half morty, half[burps] who--who knows wh-what? it's my bad, guys, i'll--i'll take care of it, 
beth: grandpa rick, no, no! 
jerry: whoa, whoa, whoa! 
beth: dad, what do you think you're doing?! 
rick: hey, listen--you guys quarantined the house when summer brought olives back from mexico, i mean, this thing could grow to the size of delaware, i mean, it might eat brains and exhale space aids, we got to be careful, 
morty: i lost the chance to be careful, rick, i'm a father now! you know, it's time for me to be responsible, isn't that right... 
rick: don't name it! 
morty: morty jr? 
rick: oh, crap, he named it, 
beth: well, dad, it's a living thing, and it's half human, 
jerry: and it was born on american soil, which entitles it to-- 
beth: jerry, majoring in civics was your mistake, don't punish for it, 
rick: fine, i'm gonna take this thing to my workshop and do a little bit of investigating, do not let that thing out of your sight, it looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous, 
jerry: like the insane clown posse, 
rick: yeah, good one, jerry, 2003 just called, it wants its easy target back, 
morty: ohh, he's like a little me! y-you don't think he'll turn into a monster, do you? 
beth: they always do, 
jerry: hey, uh, 1995 called! they want their"certain year called wanting its'blank'back"formula back! 
beth: why, jerry? why expend the effort? 
jerry: life is effort, and i'll stop when i die! 
rick: out 
summer: whatcha doin'? 
rick: well, i can't solve the problem my way, thanks to your family's primitive biological hang-ups, gross, i might have just touched one of morty's loads, but maybe i can find suitable parents for morty jr, on this robot's home world, which is... gazorpazorp in the andromeda system scoot, summer, 
summer: don't you need a new companion now that morty's in the family way? 
rick: i don't do adventures with chicks, summer, 
summer: oh, right--because there's something about having a wiener that would make me better at walking through a hole? aaaaaaaaaaaaah! 
rick: oh, crap, 
summer: grandpa rick! ugh! help! help! aah! aah![roars] 
summer: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! grandpa rick! 
rick: still think it's a good idea to go through holes without a wiener? 
summer: i want to go home, 
rick: yeah, no duh, ugh! 
summer:[gasps][all snarling] 
rick: great, now i have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs, 
jerry: you're doing great morty, 
morty: really? you think? i mean, i'm not doing much of anything, what do i do if it cries? 
beth: then you put it down and let it cry itself out, 
jerry: yeah, right, we tried that technique on summer, and she's gonna end up stripping, isn't she? yes, she is, she's gonna strip for attention because she was denied it, 
beth: stop filling it with your own insecurity, you're gonna turn it into morty--uh, mm--more--more--more--more of you, 
jerry: well, we can't all be raised like reptiles by a mentally ill scientist... what the--aah! aah![crying] 
beth: listen to me, i am not rewarding this behavior, 
morty: knock it off, both of you! g-give me him! give me my baby! you're both nuts! i'm gonna raise morty jr, myself!♪ where's your hands?♪♪ there's your hands♪♪ and that's how we play handy hands♪ 
jerry: oh, you are going to ruin that kid, morty, 
beth: at least we can agree on that, 
[ all snarling ] [ growling ] 
rick: thanks, dum-dum,[roars] 
rick: i said,"rhanks, dum-dum,"go get more, summer, put your burka on! 
summer: that burka is a human-rights violation, and i spent a lot on this top, 
rick: look, i'm trying to repair a p-portal gun with a bunch of sex-doll parts, and i have to do it one-handed to keep these belushis from carting you off, the least you could do is be ashamed of your gender, 
summer: ugh, what's the deal with this place? why is it such a sausage planet, and how did such backward idiots invent robots? 
rick: obviously, at some point, the gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines, the resultant lack of distraction and hen-pecking allowed them to focus entirely on war, so they bombed themselves back to the stone age, and now they just fight with each other over fake[bleep] with sticks and rocks all day long, 
summer: you think it's efficient to get rid of women? 
rick: you ever see a line for the men's room? are you hear--do you li--do you hear me, summer? 
[ rumbling ] droppin' loads,

[ all murmuring ] yeah, baby! 
rick: summer, grab--grab hold, 
yeah,  baby!  rick: aaaah! 
summer: grandpa rick, where are we going? 
rick: well, obviously, summer, it appears the lower tier of this society is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class, sound familiar? 
summer:[gasps] ticketmaster, 
rick: oh, there--there we go, summer, hey--hey, brother, hey, bro, nice racket you got going on here, listen, i'm rick sanchez from earth dimension c-137, don't mean you any harm, coming in peace, it's all cool in the, uh--"good in the neighborhood"is what i was trying to come--is what i meant, oh, i get it--the old behind-every-great-man amazon twist, 
gazorpazorpian: silence! 
rick:[choking][coughs] 
gazorpazorpian: your slave is ill-mannered, 
summer: my slave? 
gazorpazorpian: we assume you are from a more primitive world, where men are still permitted to be servants, if he is a rogue male, tell us now and we will kill him, 
summer: he's my slave, he's my slave, he's definitely my slave, 
rick:[chokes] ugh! ohh! oh-ho-ho! oh, boy, what's the opposite of"wubba-lubba-dub-dubs"? am i right, ladies and gentlemen? are you guys kidding me? 
morty: oh, morty jr,! you're gonna be a special little guy, aren't you? you--oh, yeah, you're my special little guy, ohh, ohh! ha ha! mortimer smith jr da, 
morty: what was that, morty jr,? were you gonna say,"dada"? say,"dada,"mortimer smith jr death! 
morty:"dada," 
mortimer smith jr: damnation! 
morty: um"dada"? 
mortimer smith jr: destruction, domination, 
jerry:[clears throat] nice, 
overhead: the spider in sector"c"is still alive, plan your route accordingly and expect delays, we're not telling you what to do, we're just sharing how we feel, and now weather--is anyone else cold, or is it just me? 
mar-sha: i am mar-sha, ruler of gazorpazorp, i am here if you need to talk, 
summer: what is this place? paradise, 
mar-sha: we built it during the great passive-aggression, when the females separated from the males due to their increasingly destructive behavior, i am here if you need to talk, i am here if you need to talk, from here, we dispense mechanical surrogates to maintain our population, fertilized surrogates are returned here to our nursery, the females are placed into educational programs where they can discover a service to our paradise that fulfills them most, males... they get to play outside, 
summer: that was just a baby, 
mar-sha: and within a day, he'll be an adult male gazorpian--one of the most aggressively violent creatures in the universe, 
rick: wait a minute, we're here because a male gazorpian was born on our planet, 
summer: you speak when you're spoken to, ding-a-ling! it's true, though--one of your babies was born on earth, 
mar-sha: are you the ruler of this earth? 
summer: how did you know? the quality of your top, 
summer: do you love it? mar-sha i love it,-i'm here if you need to talk,-i'm here if you need to talk, 
summer: i'm here if you need to talk, 
mar-sha: if the gazorpian is male, your earth is in grave danger, we will give you passage back home so it can be terminated, but first, mojitos, 
rick: we don't have time for mojitos, 
summer: you are insulting them, 
rick: i don't care, summer! this place is the worst! i want to go home! 
summer: well, it really doesn't matter what you want, because this is a sane place where women rule, 
rick: yeah, you know what i have to say about that? 
[ farting ] 
[ all gasp ] 
mar-sha: i cannot believe my ears! 
rick:[farting continues] whoo, boy! who let the frogs out, huh? 
summer: grandpa! mar-sha grandpa? that sounds patriarchal! it means"father of fathers,"then this one is not your slave, and your earth is yet another planet dominated by men, 
rick: it's not dominated by us, okay? on earth, men and women are equals, 
summer: equals?! we make 70 of your salary for the same job! 
mar-sha: seize them! 
rick: whoa! was this really the time to make that point, summer? 
mortimer smith jr: this is for you, daddy, 
morty: oh, man! um, okay, listen to me, morty jr, i've got to tell you something very important, okay? killing is bad--bad! 
[ giggles ] 
mortimer smith jr: you're silly, daddy, 
morty: no, morty jr, i'm being serious, okay? you need to put your energy into something else, i mean, what about dancing? would you like to learn how to dance? 
mortimer smith jr: i'd like to dance--on the graves of my enemies, 
morty: ohh! no, morty jr,! 
mortimer smith jr: daddy, can i go outside? 
morty: no! absolutely not! 
mortimer smith jr: but that's where all the people and the animals are, 
morty: yeah, but you can't go out there because the--the air is poisonous for you! you will die--you'll die instantly if you ever leave this house! you hear me? 
mortimer smith jr: for real? 
morty: for real times a million, buddy, so, let's just stay inside, and, you know, let's try dancing, right? look at me, yay! look, we're gonna dance, come on, join--dance with me here, we love to dance, 
mortimer smith jr: why do we love to dance? 
morty: because i said so! 
[ crying ] 
beth: nice, 
jerry: nice,[indistinct conversations] 
veronica: so, what are you in for? 
rick: because i got--i got a big, you know, penis between my legs, what--what--what are you in for? 
veronica: the worst crime a female can commit, mar-sha veronica ann bennett, i find you guilty of having bad bangs, 
gazorpazorpian: you ever notice the ones with bad bangs always have three names? 
mar-sha: you are hereby sentenced to the silent treatment! 
[ all gasp ] 
rick: pfft! this is gonna be cake, no, jackie! 
mar-sha: rick and summer of earth, for the crimes of treason against womankind and for creating the sound of which we do not speak because it does not exist, you are hereby sentenced to-- 
rick: what, what, what--a night on the couch? 
mar-sha: death, 
rick: ooh, gerp, 
summer: i hate you so much right now, 
mar-sha: this will be the first instance of capital punishment in our society in 500 years due to our awesomeness, so we are forced to improvise, we placed a large boulder on that ledge, 
rick: holy shit! y-y-you're gonna crush us with a boulder?! 
mar-sha: no! stop interrupting! the boulder falls onto a lever that will launch knives, 
rick: what? just give me a gun, i'll kill myself, 
mar-sha: stop interrupting! the knives will--fine! you were right the first time, okay? the boulder crushes you, i just didn't want to admit you were right, happy? no, just ignore them, ignore them, such an asshole, 
rick: look, i'm sorry, summer, i feel bad that i let you drag us into this, i wish i could have been a better grandpa to you, and, you know, for what it's worth, that is a really nice, cute top that you're wearing there, 
summer: top, my top! my top--the same top you complimented earlier! look--look at the tag, read it, it says,"marc jacobs," 
mar-sha: marc? jacob? these are names of the penis, 
summer: yes, an earth man made this top, maybe on your planet, separation of the genders is the right thing to do, but on earth, a certain percentage of our males are born gay, which is why my clothes are better than all of yours, 
mar-sha: a man made something fashionable? it's true, and sometimes the truth hurts, but it must be accepted, like if i told you that you're using the wrong color foundation for your skin and it ends at your neck, making you look like a party clown, 
summer: okay, ouch, noted, but the fact remains if you impose gazorpazorp's laws on earth, you're no better than the men whose farts shall remain unspoken, and if you think my top is cute, you cannot execute, 
[ all gasp ] 
mar-sha: very well, give the earth people a spacecraft so they may head back to their weird planet, where women are kind of equal but not really, 
rick: good job, summer, and thanks, girls, you know, you girls are really something, i'll tell you that, you know when we first got there, i was like--give them a ship now, 
morty: morty jr,! smoking?! that is not okay! 
mortimer smith jr: what are you gonna do--ground me? i can't go outside anyway! 
morty: so what?! you could do things inside! you could play guitar, you could masturbate, 
mortimer smith jr: i don't want to masturbate, i want to conquer the planet! 
morty: oh, here we go again! you know, who do you think is gonna love you if you conquer the planet, morty jr,?! 
mortimer smith jr: love--that's all you care about! what about weapons?! what about domination of the enemy?! 
morty: all right, that's it--no more history channel! this tv is for cartoons and video games only! 
mortimer smith jr: i hate video games! 
morty: you take that back! give it to me! ugh! i-i-i didn't mean--i didn't mean that, i didn't mean to do that, i'm sorry, 
mortimer smith jr: i can't take this anymore! i'd rather breathe poison than live another minute with you! 
morty: no! no, no, no! stop! 
[ breathing deeply ] 
mortimer smith jr: my life has been a lie! god is dead! the government's lame! thanksgiving is about killing indians! jesus wasn't born on christmas! they moved the date! it was a pagan holiday!

jerry: yes, morty? 
morty: my son is gonna take over the planet, and i am too young to drive! can you help me get him back?!

jerry: [sighs contently] i tell ya, the galactic federation taking over earth--best thing that's ever happened to this family. i just got my sixth promotion this week, and i still don't know what i do. 
summer: who cares how high they promote you? everyone just gets paid in pills. 
jerry: well, when you're not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules. 
beth: summer, show your father some respect. he's pulling down a six-chewable figure income. 
[ bottle shatters ] 
conroy: i'll get that in a moment. how are everyone's pills? oh, morty, you've hardly touched your pills. 
morty: i kind of had big pills for lunch, and i[muffled] wasn't gonna eat any more pills.[gulps] thank you, conroy. 
jerry: you spoil us, conroy. 
summer:[slams hands on table] grandpa rick wouldn't put up with this! 
beth:[bangs fist on table] stop saying his name! he abandoned us. 
jerry:[bangs fist on table] willem dafoe! th-that's the guy i couldn't think of this morning. 
beth: don't make my mistake, summer. don't deify the people that leave you. you'll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses[sobs] healthy forever.[sniffles] horses live longer than tortoises now. is that what you want for yourself? 
summer: maybe i just want you to care if i run away yelling! 
conroy: who saved room for pill brûlée? 
jerry: ooh! [chuckles] 
[trans to to shoney's]
convelious daniel: i can see why you chose this family-friendly restaurant to represent your cerebellum. so safe, so comfortable, so shoney's. but admit it, rick--you're going crazy cooped up in here. let's go visit some memories. 
rick: oh, any particular ones? you want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment i discovered interdimensional travel? 
cornvelious daniel: [squeals] 
rick: ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape? 
cornvelious daniel: it's arousal. yes, i'd like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun. 
rick: yeah, well, tough titties. 
[ rumbling ] 
convelious daniel: there's no tougher titty than a psychotic break, rick. 
rick: well, that depends on who breaks first--me or the titty. 
cornvelious daniel: someone special you remember? is that your memory of her out there--between where you were on 9 11 and your favorite sports blooper? 
[ whooshing ] 
cornvelious daniel: if we stay here, you'll die, along with all your memories. if you take me where i want to go she'll be there, too, won't she? 
rick: the day i invented the portal gun is the day i lost her. 
cornvelious daniel: oh, that sounds cool. i can get what i want and you can say goodbye. 
rick: [sighs] fine, but i'm driving. 
rick:--as an excuse to strip away our freedom! 
[trans to the garage]
morty: huh? what are you--what are you doing? 
summer: grandpa rick must have some secret lab, right? with, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! and we can go break him out of prison! look at these dead flies! maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door. 
morty: summer, you're freaking me out. i know things have changed a lot, and i know you miss rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. and, you know, we're not doing so bad. 
summer: we're miserable, morty! there's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the eiffel tower! 
morty: hey, i like being i-i can rent a car now. 
summer: because you suck! you've been keeping your lip zipped about it since grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him. 
morty: he bails on everybody! he bailed on mom when she was a kid! he--he bailed on tiny planet! and in case i never made this clear to you, summer, he bailed on you. he left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! because nobody's special to him, summer, not even himself. so, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. the one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard! 
summer: you're right! 
morty: what?! no, i'm not right. i-i was using ghoulish overkill! ghoulish overkill, summer!

mcdonald s drive-thru speaker: welcome to mcdonald's. can i take your order? 
rick: yeah, i'd like to get a 10-piece mcnugget and a bunch of the szechuan sauce. like, as much as you're allowed to give me. in 1998, they had this promotion for the disney film"mulan,"where they--where they--they created a new sauce for the mcnuggets called szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! and then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. this is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory. 
cornvelious daniel: rick, you're doing this bit while your brain is melting. 
rick: okay. all right, all right. 
cornvelious daniel: is that-- 
rick: me. i used to wear blue pants.

cornvelious daniel: when'd you make the leap to interdimensional travel? 
rick: i didn't. i did. 
[ whooshing ] 
alternate rick: well, well, well. if it isn't us. you know the worst part about inventing teleportation? suddenly, you're able to travel the whole galaxy, and the first thing you learn is, you're the last guy to invent teleportation. fortunately, you're about to invent something much more powerful.

morty: summer, nobody has to know about that. we could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with dad's mannequin leg. 
summer: fine, stay here. i'll rescue grandpa myself. 
morty: and how are you gonna do that? 
summer: i don't know yet. i'll make it up as i go. that's what grandpa rick does. that's what heroes do. 
morty: y-you want to see what a hero rick is? i-i'll bring you somewhere, summer. um-

alternate rick: imagine doing anything you want, then hopping to a timeline where you never did it. imagine going anywhere, anytime, with nobody able to stop you. 
young rick: sounds lonely. 
alternate rick: lonely? dude, you have yourself--your infinite selves. it's a nonstop party where all the guests are the only person we like. you think it's cool being the smartest man on earth, but once we give you this technology, you become the smartest thing in every conceivable universe--the infinite rick, a god. 
young rick: eh, pass. 
alternate rick: excuse me? bro, ricks don't pass on this. who do you think you are? 
young rick: a different kind of rick, i guess. 
alternate rick: well, we'll see how long that lasts. 
[ whooshing ] 
diane: i heard sci-fi noises. did you make a breakthrough? 
young rick: sort of. i just took a long look at myself, and i don't think this science thing is gonna pay off.

summer: he's in prison. 
morty: summer. 
summer: he got captured by the federation and we were going to rescue him. 
guard rick: very troubling. we can't risk citadel secrets falling into the federation's hands. we'll dispatch seal team ricks immediately to break into the prison holding c-137.

gromflomite worker: holy shit, yes! yes, we got it! 
cornvelious daniel: yeah! thanks, rick. i'll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer. actually, i think it shuts off automatically once your brain is liquid. don't know, don't care. pull me out.[beat] hey, pull me out! can you hear me? 
rick: nope, they cannot. 
cornvelious daniel: why not? 
rick: because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer. 
cornvelious daniel: what are you talking about? this is a memory. y-you can't alter details of a memory. 
rick: true, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story.

gromflomite captain: one thing still perplexes me--why would rick sanchez turn himself in? 
cornvelious daniel rick: well, i'm just a dumb-ass bug, but it's possible rick knew he'd be interrogated at this facility, where we not only keep our most wanted, but our most sensitive data. anyone here with level-nine access could [burps] i don't know, collapse a government. i'm just gonna go take a dump. is it cool if i use the level-nine bathroom? w-w-what's the level-nine master access code again?

morty: it's the citadel of ricks. all the different ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government. 
summer: but if every rick hates the government, why would they hate grandpa? 
morty: because ricks hate themselves the most. and our rick is the most himself.

riq iv: it's not fair, you have no rights, and he's not a lawyer. we just keep him here because he's fun. look at him go. 
lawyer morty:[laughs] ha ha, yeah! 
riq iv: we'll be lenient if you renounce your rick. what say you, summer? 
summer: i say[bleep] you! my grandpa was my hero. you killed him because you were jealous of him. that's pretty obvious from the haircuts. so do what you want to me, but let my brother go. he already renounced rick. 
riq iv: morty? 
lawyer morty:[whispers indistinctly] 
morty: what? n-no, i don't want to see your pog collection. i don't renounce rick, and i never have. i was just trying to protect my sister. i wanted you to have a normal life. that's something you can't have when rick shows up. everything real turns fake. everything right is wrong. all you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. and, well--well, he's not a villain, summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. he's more like a demon or a super[bleep] up god. 
riq iv: let's not suck the ghost of his[bleep] too hard. he was a terrorist, and now he's dead.

summer: oh, my god. he's not bluffing. he's not bluffing! 
morty: r-rick? 
riq iv: why not shoot through her? 
rick: 20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, my first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. the risk to me is minimized if i wait for you to shoot her, which i'm encouraging you to do. 
summer: what the[bleep] 
rick: or let her go, which i will reward with a quicker death. 
riq iv: because you love her! 
rick: because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. but if you want to die slower than that, i'm super into it. all you got to do to get that started is kill the girl. 
summer: i hate you! 
rick: not an issue, sweetie. 
morty: that's enough! drop the gun, rick! 
rick: morty, i know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really[bleep] this up right now.

morty: snuffles. 
rick: snuffles, shake. 
(snuffles understands his and shakes) 
rick: roll over. 
(snuffles rolls over) 
rick: go to the bathroom. 
(snuffles goes out of the room, a toilet flush is heard, and then he returns) 
jerry: holy crap! 
summer: no way. 
rick: yeah, you're at the top of your game now, jerry. have fun. come on, morty. 
(rick and morty go into the garage) 
morty: that was fantastic, rick! 
rick: yeah, morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one. 
(rick shows morty a tiny metal ear-piece like device) 
morty: w-w-w-what is it? 
rick: it's a device, morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, morty. it's just like that movie that you keep crowing about. 
morty: you talking about"inception"? 
rick: that's right, morty. this is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may- (belch)-be make sense. 
morty:"inception"made sense. 
rick: you don't have to try to impress me, morty. listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, mr. goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you a's in math, morty. that way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, morty, all the time. 
morty: geez, rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework? 
rick: are you listening to me, morty? homework is stupid. the whole point is to get less of it. 
(rick and morty get into the space cruiser and start going off) 
rick: come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. w-we're gonna incept your teacher. you're frustrating me. 
(mr. goldenfold is in his home, watching tv on the couch, eating nachos, half asleep) 
mrs pancakes: you don't know me! 
mr goldenfold: nice, mrs. pancakes real nice. 
(mr. goldenfold falls asleep just as rick and morty sneak in through his window) 
commercial announcer: next week on"the days and nights of mrs. pancakes" 
mrs pancakes: you don't know me! 
mr pancakes: then let me get to know yo, damn it! 
rick: uh-oh! spoilers! 
(rick quickly turns off the tv) 
rick: i'm a full season behind. 
morty: wow, rick, i can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in mr. goldenfold's house. it's really weird. 
rick: it's about to get a whole lot weirder, morty. 
(rick puts inception devices on everyone and they enter mr. goldenfold's dream. here, he is sitting on the airplane and mrs. pancakes is the flight attendant serving snacks) 
mrs pancakes: wheat thins. wheat thins. 
mr goldenfold: i'll take two. 
mrs pancakes: oh, i think you've had enough, sir. 
mr goldenfold: you don't know me. 
rick: all right, morty, time to make our move. 
(rick grabs some sodas and a cloth while mr. goldenfold and mrs. pancakes play around with each other) 
mr goldenfold: make it bounce. 
mrs pancakes: no, you didn't. 
mr goldenfold: oh, jiggle it now. 
mrs pancakes: you better stop with that. 
(rick and morty jump out, disguised as muslim terrorists, wearing soda bottles as bombs and morty wearing the cloth on his head like an islamic woman) 
rick: allahu (belch) akbar! we're gonna take control of this plane! we're gonna 9 11 it unless morty smith gets better grades in math! 
(the passengers are frozen in shock, but mr. goldenfold gets up and stands against him) 
rick: hey! i said nobody move, buddy! 
mr goldenfold: the name's not buddy. it's goldenfold. nice to wheat you! 
(mr. goldenfold throws a bunch of wheat thins at them, and it cuts their flesh like ninja stars) 
rick: take cover, morty! 
(mr. goldenfold suddenly takes out two giant firearms and starts firing them at the two, just after rick and morty hide behind the seats, sheltering themselves from the attacks.) 
mr goldenfold: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
morty: ooohhh! 
rick: goldenfold's got more control here than i anticipated. i mean, the guy teaches high-school math. (belch) i didn't take him for an active dreamer. we've got to take him out so he wakes up, morty but we can't get killed. if you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, morty. 
morty: what?! are you kidding me?! ohhhhhh! 
rick: don't be a baby! you avoid getting shot in real life all the time, morty. just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine! 
(jerry is in the living room, controlling snuffles and showing to beth how cool it is) 
jerry: now bring me my slippers. 
(snuffles brings jerry his slippers) 
summer: now, be my footstool, snuffles. 
(snuffles stands in front of her and summer rests her feet there) 
jerry: this is what i'm talking about. this is a dog. 
beth unimpressed: oh, yeah. this should play out just fine. 
jerry: you said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what? 
(everyone is silent for a few seconds while beth gives him blank stare. jerry slowly starts to fade into a depressed state as beth walks off, leaving him) 
snuffles: ooowwwwowowwaawaa! 
summer: oh, my god! he's trying to tell us something. (offscreen) that is so awesome. 
snuffles: aaaawwaaaaawaawa! 
jerry: aw, he's saying"i love lasagna". 
snuffles: ooooyayawawa! 
summer: he's saying"i love obama". (offscreen) so cute! i'm posting this (onscreen) online, like, right now. 
jerry: i should call bob saget. is that still a thing? 
(jerry and summer leave the room and snuffles sadly walks over the the glass door and sees his helmet in the reflection) 
snuffles: hmm? 
(snuffles finds the battery case on his helmet and then goes into the kitchen, where he finds a drawer full of batteries) 
(mr. goldenfold is still shooting things up in the plane and rick attempts to make peace with him) 
rick: goldenfold, we're coming out! we just want to talk! 
mr goldenfold: why would i negotiate with you? 
rick: because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. and because i have a human shield. 
(rick takes out mrs. pancakes) 
mr goldenfold: mrs. pancakes! aaaaaaaahhhh!!!!! 
plane passengers: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
rick: oh, no, morty. his subconscious is panicking. 
plane passenger: oh no! run! 
(one of the passengers beats the airlock off the plane and everyone flies out) 
plane passengers: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
rick: whoa! whoa! whoa! whoooooaaaa! whoa! whoa! whoooooaaaa! 
morty: whooooa! whoooooooa! whoa! whooooooooaaaaa! 
(rick and morty fall out of the plane, plummeting to their dooms) 
morty: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!! 
rick: relax, morty. look! mrs. pancakes has a parachute. come on! 
(rick and morty grab onto mrs. pancakes are her parachute deploys) 
mrs pancakes: hey, you don't know me! 
morty: oh, no, rick, look! goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a (offscreen) mechanical arm to pluck mrs. pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall-into a giant vat of lava! 
rick: pretty concise, morty. looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. that's it, morty! prolonging the inevitable! listen, if we go into mrs. pancakes'dream, everything will go 100 times slower, morty. that'll buy us some time to figure this out! 
mrs pancakes: you don't know m- 
(rick slaps mrs. pancakes, knocking her out, and then incepts her dream with morty) 
rick: all right, let's go. 
(rick and morty go inside of her dream which is a bizarre s&amp;m dungeon filled with obscure gooey, monstrous, alien-like creatures) 
morty: oh, man, rick, this is pretty weird. 
rick: don't judge, morty. 
morty: okay. all right, well look, mrs. pancakes is right over there. i'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up. 
rick: whoa, whoa, morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. listen to me. if we're gonna incept mrs. pancakes, we have to blend. i'll talk to you after lunch. 
(rick leaves morty and blends in and then morty in confronted by a sexualized creature) 
sexualized swamp monster: ooh, hey! 
morty: ooh, oh! oh, man. 
(many more creatures come up and try to seduce him, making him more uncomfortable) 
sexualized swamp monster: come and join us. 
(morty starts running) 
morty: i'm sorry. no, no. 
sexualized swamp monster: ooh, come here! 
morty: no, thanks! 
giant frog woman: ooh, wow!-come over here, baby! 
morty: no, i'm okay. 
(morty bumps into a human being who looks very hot) 
morty: whoa! 
(the human is revealed to be his sister, summer) 
morty shocked: summer?! 
summer: hey, there, stranger. what do you think of these things? 
(summer shakes her tits in his face) 
morty: ohh! oh! gross! gross! 
(morty starts running away from her and rick comes up) 
rick: whoa, whoa, whoa! what's the matter with you, morty? calm down! you're kind of killing the vibe in here. 
morty: it's summer! aw, geez. 
rick: looks like goldenfold has some predilections so shameful he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams, including a pervy attraction to your underage sister.
summer: can you blame him? come on, old man, little boy. let's make an inter-generational sandwich. 
rick in unison with morty: oh, my god. put some clothes on for the love of god summer! put some-i'm gunna puke! i swear to god i'm gunna puke! 
morty in unison with rick: oh, my god! put some clothes on, for pete's sake! this is disgusting! i can't take it, rick! 
(everyone in the dungeon starts noticing them and then an angry centaur who is very much in charge shows up) 
centaur: sexual hang-ups in the pleasure chamber are punishable by death! off with their heads! 
rick: time to go another dream deep, morty! 
(rick pops the neck of the centaur and they hook up more devices and incept his dream) 
(rick and morty appear in a dark and horrid red rusted chamber where the centaur is shuttering in fear) 
morty: what the hell? why would mr. goldenfold's dream version of mrs. pancakes' dream version of a centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, rick?
rick: geez, i don't know, morty. wha-what do you want from me? 
(a horrible freddy krueger monster named scary terry shows up, and starts to horrify them) 
scary terry: welcome to your nightmare, bitch! raaaaawwwrrr! 
rick: oh, here we go! 
morty: ooooooohhhhh! holy crap! 
(rick and morty start running and scary terry chases after them) 
rick: looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an'80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives. 
scary terry: i'm scary terry. you can run, but you can't hide, bitch! 
(jerry and summer are in the living room and snuffles appears with a robotic arm attached to his helmet) 
jerry: whoa! hey, buddy. what you got going on there? 
(snuffles is now able to communicate and speak english through the helmet) 
snuffles: snuffles fix. make better. 
summer: humans understand snuffles now? that is awesome! 
snuffles: snuffles want to be understood. snuffles need to be understood. 
jerry: okay, yeah. i get what beth was talking about. fun's over. 
summer: whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away. 
jerry: why not? 
summer: i don't know. it's indian giving. 
(snuffles turns on the tv to a documentary on dogs and starts watching it) 
tv: a sophisticated predator, nature's perfect killing machine, the vicious wolf stalks its prey with purpose and skill. it was only with years of selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast was transformed into man's subservient little buddy. 
summer: aw! oh, my god! he recognizes the other dogs on tv. 
(back in the dream, rick and morty are running for their lives, when they come across a creepy singing jump roping girl) 
little girl:"a,""b"his name is scary terry"c,""d"he's very scary. 
rick: holy crap! we have to escape into someone else's dreams, morty! 
morty: oh, man, oh, man, oh, man! 
little girl:"e,""f"he'll design your death 
rick: the little girl! 
morty: huh? 
(rick and morty knock out the little girl and incept her dream, only to go into a place exactly like the one they're already in) 
little girl:"j,""k,"he'll really ruin your day. 
rick: are you kidding me? this again? oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, morty. 
morty: oh, geez, rick. w-w-whoa, this isn't good. 
scary terry: nothing but fear from here on out, bitch! 
morty: ohhhh! 
rick: holy crap, morty. he can travel through dreams. he can travel through dreams! we're so screwed! 
(summer is sleeping in the middle of the night but is then woken up by snuffles, who now has an entire robot body) 
snuffles: where are my testicles, summer?... where are my testicles, summer? they were removed. where have they gone? 
summer scared: oh, wow. that's an intense line of questioning, snuffles. 
snuffles: do not call me that! 
(snuffles smashes the mirror, making summer shriek in fear) 
snuffles:"snuffles"was my slave name. you shall now call me snowball, because my fur is pretty and white. 
summer: okay, snowball, just calm down, okay? you're scaring me. 
snuffles: scaring you? 
(snuffles smashes the mirror, making summer shriek in fear) 
summer: aaaaaaahhh!!!!! 
snuffles: tell me, summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund? 
summer: uhhh... 
(beth and jerry rush into the room, hearing her scream and they notice snuffles) 
jerry: hey. oh, wow. okay, is is is everything okay in here? 
snuffles: jerry, come to rub my face in urine again? 
jerry scared: no! no, we were uh, just seeing if summer wanted to uh... 
beth scared: g-go on, um, one of our famous midnight family walks! 
summer: yeah. totally. let's go. 
(beth, jerry, and summer try to leave, but they are stopped by another dog with a robotic mind control suit) 
snuffles: you will walk when it is time to walk. 
(screen cuts to black for the intermission break) 
rick: what are we here for again? incepting? we're trying to incept- 
morty: we're trying to incept me to get an"a"in math? 
rick: oh, yeah. 
(scary terry appears in the car) 
scary terry: buckle up, bitch! 
morty: ooooooaaahhh! 
(rick and morty start running) 
morty: man, he sure says"bitch"a lot! 
scary terry: you can run, but you can't hide, bitch! 
rick: hold on, morty. y-you know what? he keeps saying we can run but we can hide. i say we try hiding. 
morty: but that's the opposite of what- 
rick: yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything? 
morty: hey, you know what? you got a really good point there, rick. like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? i-i-i think it's a good idea, rick. 
rick: worst-case scenario we're back to running. 
(a time lapse transition to card shows up, reading "six dream hours later". rick and morty are seen hiding and scary terry goes past them, still looking for them and not knowing where they are) 
morty: wow, you know what? i mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. boy, rick, that was some good thinking. 
rick: thanks, morty. yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while. 
scary terry: you can run but you can't hide! (yawn) 
rick: oh, this is perfect, morty. look at that. he's getting sleepy. just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. that's when we make our move. 
(scene cuts back to the dogs. they are working in a factory and jerry, summer, and beth are seen, trapped in a cage.) 
jerry: snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! this is a huge misunderstanding. 
summer: dad, he wants to be called snowball. 
jerry: well, i'm not calling him that. that's ridiculous. 
snuffles: you're being very aggressive, jerry. perhaps tomorrow dr. scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery. 
(another dog comes out with a pair of mayo scissors) 
jerry: huh! you think you can control me with a haircut? 
(scene cuts back to the dream realm. cary terry is going back home to his family.) 
scary melissa: hi, honey. you're home early. how was your day? 
scary terry: i don't want to talk about it! 
scary melissa angry: oh, of course! you never want to talk about it! 
scary terry angry: get off my back, bitch! 
(scary brandon, the baby, starts crying) 
scary melissa angry: out there. not in here! 
scary terry: yeah, i know, i know. i shouldn't take my anger out on you or scary brandon. i love you, melissa. 
scary melissa: i love you, too, terry. 
(rick and morty are watching from outside the window) 
rick: morty, this is perfect. after a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him. 
(rick and morty go into the terry's room, when terry and melissa are fast asleep) 
rick: looks like scary terry's having a nightmare. 
morty: oh, boy, rick. i can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare scary terry. 
(rick and morty incept his dream and he's having a school related dream) 
scary terry: oh, no! i'm late to class, bitch! oh, no! i'm not wearing any pants! 
(scary terry goes to class) 
monster teacher: ah, well, mr. terry, why don't you tell the whole class the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch? 
scary terry: oh, uh, um..."bitch." 
(the class laughs at him) 
monster teacher: oh, come on, terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch? morty hey, leave him alone! 
rick: yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants? 
monster teacher: well, i never! i-i see no reason to stand here and take this. 
rick: you're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary terry. you know, i mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is. 
morty: hey, yo, scary t., don't even trip about your pants dawg. here's a pair on us, fool. 
scary terry: aww, bitch. i don't know what to say. 
morty: you don't need to say anything. we got you, dawg. 
rick: you're our boy, dawg. don't even trip. 
(scary terry wakes up from his dream and sees rick and morty) 
scary terry: oh, hey, it's you guys! 
(that morning, rick, morty, and the terry family are having breakfast in the kitchen) 
scary melissa: i haven't seen him this relaxed in years. 
scary terry: if you guys ever need anything, just say the word. 
rick: as a matter of fact, terry, there is something you could help us with. 
(rick, morty, and terry escape the dream and confront the little girl) 
little girl:"q,""r,"you won't get very far. 
scary terry: i always hated that song! 
(scary terry kills the little girl and then goes on to the centaur) 
scary terry: these halves don't belong together, bitch! 
(scary tells kills the centaur and moves onto mrs. pancakes) 
scary terry: sex is sacred! 
(scary terry kills mrs. pancakes and launches himself at mr. goldensfold) 
scary terry: this is because you don't give morty smith good grades, bitch! 
(scary terry destroys mr. goldenfold, causing him to wake up from his dream, in shock) 
mr goldenfold: holy crap! god damn! i know one thing for sure i'm giving morty an"a"in math, and that's my idea. that is an original thought. 
(rick and morty fist bump behind the couch) 
morty: what the hell? 
rick: out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, morty? 
morty: oh, man, what's going on? 
rick: well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on jerry, beth, and summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, morty. 
jerry: i can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart. 
summer: this is why i choose to get c's. 
rick: psst, beth, jerry, summer. 
morty: -dad! -rick! -oh, thank god, morty. 
rick: oh, you're welcome. all right, let's get out of here.
rick: if we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over. 
jerry: whoa, whoa, whoa. we're not going anywhere. this is my house. i'm not abandoning it. 
rick: it's all over, jerry. the dogs are on a path to total world domination. but, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?
jerry: wait a minute. i have an idea. gentlemen, a moment of your time. (jerry pees on a pile of guns) see that? i'm peeing all over your special guns. that means i own them. 
snuffles: bad person. bad. 
rick: ooh, great plan, jerry. 
snuffles: bring the boy to me. you were always kind to me, morty. that's why i will leave you with your testicles. from now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side. 
morty: th-thanks, snuffles. 
snuffles: begin phase two. 
(the military can be seen on tv fighting the dogs) 
reporter: fighting continues as the dog army captures the eastern seaboard. it appears clear at this time that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end. (two dogs come into the news room with a muzzle) please! please don't kill me!
dog 1: what's she saying, bill? 
bill: i think she's saying, "i love lasagna". 
(morty is in a bed with two naked girls, and a dog brings him refreshments) 
morty: mmm. thank you, fido. rick! i thought you were dead! 
rick: no, no, no, i was just playing dead. good news, though, morty. this whole thing's gonna be over really soon. 
morty: what? 
rick: it's a dream, morty. we're in your dog's dream. the night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. then i used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles'dream. 
morty: but i-it's been like a whole year! 
rick: it's been six hours. dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. so, you know, every day here is like a minute. it's like"inception,"morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie. 
morty: aw, man. i really liked this life. well, at least i didn't really crap my pants. 
rick: no, no, that happened before you went to sleep, morty. you're sleeping in your crap right now. out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. i mean, it's a mess out there. i got some on my hands, morty, and then i got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth. 
morty: aw, man, geez! seriously? 
rick: look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, morty. here, here take these, morty. take these. 
morty: are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something? 
rick: close. it's gonna make your kidneys shut down. 
morty: what?! 
rick: it's necessary for the plan, morty. don't even trip, dawg. 
(snuffles and a few other dogs, rick also dressed up as one, stand around morty, who looks close to death on his medical table) 
dr dog: it's pretty bad, emperor snowball. we're gonna need to do another operation. 
snuffles: anything. anything for my precious morty. 
accountant dog: sir, as your accountant, i must advise you that these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy. you could lose your kingdom. 
snuffles: to hell with my kingdom, bean counter. i would trade it all for my human's health and happiness. 
accountant dog: do you think they would have done this for us? 
snuffles: we are not them! we are not them. 
(snuffles wakes up from the dream) 
assemble the troops. i've made a decision. (outside where the dogs are seen portaling to another world) 
snuffles: taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory. 
morty: i'm gonna miss you, snowball. 
snuffles: you can call me snuffles, morty, and i'm going to miss you, too, very much. 
(snuffles portals away, jerry starts tearing up) 
beth: jerry? 
jerry: i'm sorry. it's just like the end of old yeller. 
beth: oh, jerry. you mean because it had dogs in it. 
morty: wow! a whole world populated by intelligent dogs. i wonder what it'll be like, rick. 
rick: i think it will be great, morty. you know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. i mean, i'd watch it, morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. you know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven. 
morty: you know, that's a real comforting idea, rick. 
rick: what do you know, morty? what do you know? 
(after credits rick and scary terry are in terry's dream in a classroom) 
scary glenn: hi, guys. i'm your new teacher for scary class. my name is scary mr. johnson. uh, actually, you know what? that's my dad's name, so why don't you just call me scary glenn, yeah? so, anyway, i understand your previous teacher was having you work on fundamentals of fear. which is what is that? you know? so, uh, here here's what i say you can't learn anything until you learn how to chill. 
rick: oooh! this is how you dream, bitch. (terry and rick are getting stoned) 
[int. smith household - day] 
it is christmas morning at the smith house. jerry, merry, rich, and fat, comes down in a silk robe holding a festive mug. he sits down and a grim and pale beth follows. she is holding a glass of wine but has no desire to drink it. 
jerry: (cheerily) merry christmas beth! isn't christmas morning just the most magical time of the year! a time for family and friends to get together and celebrate the joy of- 
pov of beth. : jerry is rambling on and on about christmas but all beth hears is muffled nonsense. she's tuned him out completely. 
beth: suck it jerry. summer and her obviously older boyfriend walk into the room. summer is wearing barely any clothes. her boyfriend picks up one of rick's old gadgets and summer snaps at him. 
summer: don't touch that! go sit on the couch. the couple sit on the couch and morty sluggishly walks downstairs. he looks like a zombie. skinny, kind of green, and drooling. 
jerry: merry christmas morty! morty blankly stares at jerry and then flips him off. morty plops down next to summer. there is a beat of awkward silence and then a giant spaceship crashes into the house. it runs right into summer's boyfriend but kills no one else. rick falls out. 
rick: get in!! now! summer grabs morty and runs to the ship. beth follows. jerry protests. 
jerry: are you kidding me?! it is christmas morning! you're really going to go with him after all the crap he's put us through?! 
rick: whatever jerry you don't have to come. you can stay here on your precious planet and become a sex slave to a mentally and physically superior alien race. i'm sure theres a few chubby chasers on this planet that will pay good money for you. jerry tries to work up a comeback but fails. he gets in the ship. they fly off. 
[ext. space - moments later] 
rick is flying his dinged up ship while the entire family (except morty) is yelling and screaming questions at rick. 
rick: whoa whoa hey hey calm down. i'm assuming you wanna know how i broke out. well... rick looks directly into the camera. 
rick: you little shits wouldn't stop asking for it so welcome to season 3 motherfuckers! we about to shawshank all up in this bitch! wubbalubbadubdub! rick and morty 
[int. prison - day] 
rick is standing in his honeycomb cell as it is being lowered to the ground by a giant mechanical arm. his cell is unlocked, his braces are opened, and guards escort him through the main floor of the prison. 
[int. prison- cafeteria - continuous action] 
rick looks among the prison with disgust in his face. every single creature in the prison is terrifying and grotesque. rick makes sustained eye contact with a weird looking alien eating food through it's asshole. rick cringes and shakes his head. a prisoner jumps at one of the guards holding rick. the prison looks an awful lot like doc brown from back to the future except for some discoloration. he is crazy and scurries around like a mouse on crack. 
guard  1: hey! watch it! 
prisoner: (yelling into space) we must return to the future! the prisoner grabs the guard by the shoulders and shakes him. 
prisoner: we have to stop biff!! more guards come and tackle the prisoner to the ground. rick keeps walking and looks back at the crazy guy who is now being tazzed. 
prisoner  (o. s.) : great scott!!!! 
rick: jesus christ. what's he in for? 
guard  2: that one? he's a real sicko. he used to camp outside of high schools and bait teenage boys into his car by telling them he could time travel. the guards sit rick down at a table. 
guard  1: you're free to eat here. but make it quick. you have to go into questioning in 15 minutes. 
rick: what (burps) ever. stan, an older man who has clearly seen some shit in his day, sits down across from rick. rick, without even looking up to see the man says... 
rick: if you're here to ask me for a blowjob you can get in line. mr. eats-where-i-shit-and-shits-where-i-eat has first dibs. 
stan: they are going to ask about your portal gun. rick is suddenly interested. 
rick: what? how do you know that? 
stan: i saw them walk into the interrogation room with it. i'm assuming its yours considering you seem like the only intelligent life form here. 
rick: i mean yeah obviously its mine. but... uh... thanks for the heads up... uhhh 
stan: stan. no problem. stan gets up and walks away. rick doesn't eat any food. the guards come and walk him over to the interrogation room. shawshank rick-demption 4rick and morty 5 
[int. interrogation room] 
rick sits down in an all white room. two square looking scientists walk into the room and sit in front of rick. one of them puts the portal gun on the table. 
scientist  1: mr. sanchez. we need to know how you mastered inter-dimensional time travel. 
scientist  2: in all of our years of research, we have never seen a device quite like this. 
rick: it's a fucking portal gun. its really not complicated. 
scientist  1: if its really that simple, tell us how you made it. 
rick: yeah. right. 
scientist  2: if you tell us, we can negotiate to lower your prison sentence. 
rick: not interested. what were you guys doing going through my shit anyway? 
scientist  1: (growing impatient) tell us how you made the portal gun. 
rick: or what? you'll tell your boss bitch tammy that i'm not cooperating? scientist 1 pulls out a gun and holds it to rick's head. 
rick: cute. 
scientist  2: what fuels the gun? a sly grin slowly stretches along rick's face. 
rick: my jizz. scientist 2 immediately drops the portal gun. 
scientist  2: what?! 
rick: you heard me. my jizz. 
scientist  1: stop messing around! 
rick: i'm not! i can whip up some fuel for you right now and we can take this baby out for a test drive. the scientists start to grab their stuff and run out of the room. 
scientist  2: you're sick! 
rick: oooo yeah name calling! come on science boy i'm almost there! we hear the guards vomiting off screen and then summer's voice. 
summer  (o. s.) : ew! are you serious? 
[int. rick's spaceship - present] 
back in rick's spaceship everyone is cringing in disgust. 
rick: obviously not summer. i'm not that fucked up. the gun runs of quadric acid. also, here... rick throws summer a lab coat. 
rick: put this on. i can't even look at you when you're dressed like that. you used to just have hints of daddy issues but now you might as well have it tattooed on your goddamn forehead. 
jerry: hey! 
rick: hey what? clearly i was the only thing holding your family together jerry. 
beth: dad, where are we going? 
rick: honestly, i don't know. i didn't think i'd make it this far. jerry is infuriated. 
jerry: (yelling) what?! so we are just flying around and waiting for the cops to catch us? our life was perfect without you! we were wealthy and happy and safe and now we are fugitives on the run! y'know what? let the cops catch us! so we can go home and you can go back to prison! as jerry finishes his temper tantrum, two space cops pull up behind rick's spaceship. 
rick: oh great now you've really done it jerry. morty, get the gun out of my glove compartment. morty blankly stares at rick. while staring back at morty, rick asks... 
rick: what the hell did you guys do to morty? 
beth: well, after you left, morty got really depressed. he wouldn't get out of bed or eat. so we decided to put him on anti-depressants... for horses. 
rick: what?! 
beth: well it was the only thing available to us, dad! 
rick: i'll fix it later. summer grab the wheel. summer leans forward to grab the wheel and rick grabs the gun. he sticks his hand out of the window of his ship and starts shooting at the cops. he takes down both ships and sits back in the drivers seat. 
rick: we got those guys but there will be more any second now. but first, lets finish this story. 
[int. interrogation room - day] 
rick is back in the white interrogation room before. tammy, the bitch who got him locked up, walks into the room. she circles rick and then slams her hands on the table. 
tammy: give me the fuel to the portal gun. 
rick: jesus tammy. all this just so you can have a piece of the rick? i mean you did kill my best friend... 
tammy: no you asshole, the real fuel. i know your gun doesn't run on your... jizz. 
rick: did your scientist boyfriends tell you that? 
tammy: those scientists are the best in the galaxy... 
rick: yet they get grossed out by a little rick juice. 
tammy: oh dear god. 
rick: hey look, i'm just... i'm just saying that it is a natural human bodily function and there is no reason... 
tammy: just tell me how to fuel the gun. 
rick: (speaking over tammy) there is no reason to be ashamed ofmy body. 
tammy: (annoyed) sanchez tell me how to fuel the gun. rickwith. my. rick. juice. 
tammy: please stop calling it that. 
rick: you swallow, don't you? 
tammy: what? this is a completely inappropriate. 
rick: oh, so you spit? 
tammy: i swear to god i will make your life a living hell. 
rick: spitters are quitters tammy. 
tammy: just tell me how to fuel the gun. 
rick: oh my god i told you already! tammy gets annoyed and starts to head towards the door. rick hey! hey! tell your scientist boyfriends that i say hi! and that sometimes late at night when i'm making more fuel i... as tammy walks out the door tammy turns around and calmly says 
tammy: have your fun now rick. you'll be dead in a month. the sly grin on rick's face sinks into a look of fear. the room slowly goes dark. 
act 2: shawshank rick-demption 10rick and morty 11 
[int. prison yard - day] 
rick and stan sit and talk about life on a bench in a busy prison yard. 
stan:... so does the gun really run on your... 
rick: naw, i just like fucking with these d-bags. 
stan: (laughing) okay good. 
rick: so how'd you end up in here? 
stan: aren't you not supposed to ask questions like that? 
rick: so did you kill somebody? 
stan: (sighs) i used to work for the intergalactic government and then i realized how corrupt they all were. so one morning, i quit. i went to a bar to get a quick drink so i could tell my wife and kids but when i went home they were all dead. i'm not much of a fighter so i decided the only way to get real revenge was to spill all of the governments secrets. publish journals and articles about it. tell the whole universe about the shit that goes on behind closed doors. i preached and publicly spoke for about 6 years. eventually they caught me. they ran experiments on me to try to erase my memory but it never really worked. so they just locked me up in here until i die. i've been here for 35 years. sometimes i wish they would just kill me. beat of silence. 
rick: ho. ly. balls. are you serious?! stan stares blankly at him. 
rick: dude that's fucking amazing!!! oh man you are just... you are just one crazy son of a bitch. you're just so intense... i fucking love it! oh man here, you want a drink? against all odds, rick has a flask in his pocket. just go with it. stan takes the flask and drinks. 
stan: so, whats your story? 
rick: (casually) oh yknow, stole a little, killed a little, lied a little. nothing too crazy. 
stan: how'd they catch you? 
rick: i turned myself in. kinda regretting it now that i know that bitch tammy is gonna kill me in a month. i'd still be out there getting wrecked and fucking bitches if it wasn't for morty. 
stan: morty? 
rick: my idiot grandson. really really dumb kid. like reeeeaaallllyy dumb. how he didn't die on our missions is beyond me. one... one time he almost got us killed because-fade to 
[int. series of flashbacks] 
rick is having flashbacks of antics with morty from previous episodes. 
rick  (v. o.) : he had to save this weird cat chick from planet that purges. y'know like the movie? and another time he like infested his whole planet because he gave this love potion to a girl with the flu. we had to blow up that planet and move to a different one. oh! and this other time... 
[int. rick's spaceship - present] 
back in rick's spaceship summer, jerry, and beth are touched that rick has all these memories of morty. 
beth: aw, dad! you had flashbacks about morty! 
summer: you love morty! oh my god that is so cute, grandpa!!! 
jerry: now i get why you always take him on your missions and not me!! 
summer: i'm literally gonna die! this is so sweet! rick is disgusted by all the emotion. 
rick: ugh. will you all shut up. jerry, you damn straight know why we can't let your incompetent and defective ass out of the house. summer, you aren't going to die from a conversation but if you keep talking you are literally going to die. now listen to the rest of the goddamn story! 
[int. prison yard - day] 
back on the bench in the yard with stan. 
stan: so you love this morty kid? 
rick: i mean... you know... i just worry for the kid? here's this poor kid going thorough puberty and shit with literally the worst family ever. i mean his mom and sister are kinda okay. his mom, my daughter, is really smart. she practically has her husband's ball sack locked in a box on her desk. her husband is a fucking idiot. just a complete fucking failure. a pathetic excuse for a human. how any of his sperm cells were smart enough to knock up my daughter is absolutely beyond me. 
jerry  (o. s.) :... heeyyy. 
stan: well, i hope that once you break out, you'll be reunited with them. 
rick: what makes you think i'm gonna breakout? 
stan: you just handed me a flask. you are clearly one sneaky bastard who doesn't play by the rules. here. stan hands rick a plumbus, a very useful tool. rick is touched by the gift. 
rick: stan, you gorgeous fuck-muffin. thank you. 
stan: if you get caught, make sure to send them my way. rick runs back into the prison and gets to work. act 3 
[int. interrogation room - day] 
rick is back in the interrogation room with tammy. 
tammy: are you ready to tell us what the fuel is, sanchez? 
rick: i'll give you all the information you want for something in return. i have a list of items that i need for... personal reasons. you promise me these items and i'll give you answers right here, right now. tammy thinks of a bit. 
tammy: and if i don't get these items to you? 
rick: i'll fist every single person in this prison. the officials outside of the room begin whispering to each other. tammy is sweating. 
tammy: how would you... that doesn't even... 
rick: i know you'd be into it. birdperson told me about the time you and him- 
tammy: okay! okay fine! what do you want? 
rick: i need a trash bag, some wire, a sexy poster of abradolf lincler, and about 59 milliliters of acetone, chlorine trifluoride, and sodium. i'll answer six questions. 
tammy: fair enough. what fuels the portal gun? 
rick: how are you still on that?! you can ask me literally any question in the world but you still want to know what fuels my fucking portal gun? tammy realizes that she has been given a great opportunity. only problem is, all of rick's answers are either lies or so outrageous they sound like lies. 
tammy: how were you successful in sneaking illegal substances through intergalactic customs 75 times? 
rick: by shoving the items way up my ass. 
tammy: how have you managed to stay under the radar all these years? 
rick: i carry around a incompetent prepubescent teen that is so dumb, i'm able to hide under his dense and lackluster brainwaves. thus my genius goes undetected by you dick bags. 
tammy: exactly how many earths have you ruined? 
rick: jesus i don't know. like, 5? 
tammy: why did you turn yourself in? 
rick: because i felt bad for you guys. i've been pulling on your dicks for so long i figured its time to give you a fighting chance. 
tammy: how are you so self absorbed?! 
rick: i'm counting that as a question. 
tammy: tell me how to fuel the portal gun! that is my last question. 
rick: and what if i don't want to answer! 
tammy: i'll kill you right here! tammy whips out a gun and points it at rick's head. he knows she won't do it. he presses his head right up against the gun's barrel. 
rick: lick. lick. lick. my balls. tammy holds the guns firmly to his head and then lets go. 
tammy: i'll give you your shit later. you got two weeks sanchez. 
rick: you gave me a month yesterday! 
tammy: whoops. 
rick: you bitch! 
[int. prison cell - night] 
rick gets back to his cell and is given his box is chained in by his arms and feet and the cell into the air. eventually, everyone falls asleep guards start to thin out. rick uses this as his to work. of stuff. he is lifted up and the opportunity rick runs the wire up his leg and up to his hand. he picks all the locks open. he pastes the lincler poster on the front of the cell so the camera can't detect what he's doing. inside the cell he shoves the trash bag and wire into his pocket. rick deficates the plumbus. he mixes the chemicals and burns a hole into the bottom of the cell. rick jumps from cell to cell and stops at stan's cell. stan is standing on a chair with a rope tied around his neck. it looks like he's about to hang himself. 
rick: stan! don't do it! i can break us out of here! stan turns around slightly and we see he's actually jerking off. 
rick:.... oh... oh my god. alright nevermind see ya later stan. rick continues to jump from cell to cell until he reaches the ground floor. he hits all the guards on the back of the head with his plumbus and they all fall to the floor unconscious. tammy is sitting at a table, playing with her phone. the portal gun is by her side. rick sneaks up behind her and throws the trash bag over her head. he suffocates her with the trash bag. 
rick: (whispers) don't hate the player, hate the game, bitch. tammy's body falls to the ground and rick uses the rest of the chemicals to power up the portal gun. he shoots a portal into the air and jumps through. 
[ext. planet of meeseeks - continuous] 
the portal throws rick up onto the planet of meeseeks. all of the ultra helpful blue men stand around shaking each others hands. 
rick: fuck me, i hate these guys. all the blue men turn and face rick. 
meeseeks: im mr. meeseeks look at me! 
rick: hey guys. can you build me a new spaceship? i'm gonna need all of you to help. 
meeseeks: caaaaaaaan ddddooooooooooo!! 
rick: yeah sure whatever. the whole planet of meeseeks work to build rick his ship. even the babies. rain or shine they work tirelessly. in the pouring rain a meeseeks hands rick the keys. 
meeseeks: are you satisfied? 
rick: almost. i need a lab coat. a meeseeks runs up and gives him a lab coat. 
rick: perfect. now, i am satisfied. rick boards his ship and as he flies off into space we see all the meeseeks looking up at the the sky and letting the rain fall onto their face. just like the scene in shawshank. 
meeseeks: oooooooookaaaayyyy! as rick flies off we see the planet behind him explode. a meeseeks sole purpose is to please and when they have successfully done so, they explode. 
[int. rick's spaceship - present] 
the family stares at rick. disgusted by the lengths rick will go for freedom. 
beth:... i... i don't. 
summer: you killed an entire planet of meeseeks? 
rick: who are you guys to judge? like you're such a perfect fucking family? 
jerry: so whats your plan now rick? huh? how are you gonna finesse your way out of this one? 
rick: jerry, don't use words like"finesse". you don't sound smarter when you use big words you just sound more like a douchebag. i think we are just gonna have to go to a different dimension and resume our lives there. 
summer: why didn't we do that in the first place? 
rick: because summer, we wouldn't have a fucking episode if we did that. also, there should be a little vile of chemicals in the pocket of the lab coat i gave you. can you pour it in your brother's mouth? summer does with slight hesitation. rick punches morty in the face. 
morty: huh? what? where... where am i? rick? oh my god rick! 
beth: oh my god you fixed morty! how did you do that? 
rick: i don't know. those were chemicals i got at the prison mixed with some other stuff. it was either gonna kill him or cure him. life is a pretty risky game but you gotta play it if you wanna win. 
morty: what... what are you even saying rick? 
rick: what i'm saying, morty, is that you're damn lucky i saved your life before your parents took away your ability to walk. 
morty: i... how... why did you leave? you told me you weren't gonna leave! rick thinks about telling morty the truth. telling him that he left because he was tired of being a burden on the family. 
rick: look morty, i... you guys are just... he thinks about being vulnerable for the first time ever. there is a real love in rick's eyes and as he opens his mouth... 
summer: wait... what other stuff did you put in that vile? rick suddenly snaps out of it and bursts out laughing. 
morty: oh jeez don't tell me... 
rick: hope you liked my rick juice mother fucker! rick shoots a portal into the sky and the ship disappears into the green glow. tag 
[int. smith household - day] 
the smith's are gathered around the christmas tree having a hallmark family style christmas. jerry is wearing an ugly christmas sweater while sipping eggnog from his festive mug. beth is lovingly hugging jerry and morty is excitedly unwrapping presents. summer's boyfriend is a clean cut boy straight out of an old navy commercial and rick is taking pictures of the whole family. they are all laughing and spreading holiday cheer when a green portal appears in the living room and rick's spaceship crashes into the happy family, killing all of them except for morty. 
happy morty: what... what's going on? 
morty: shut up. morty shoots the happy morty in the face with a laser gun. the entire family sits in the spaceship, horrified. 
rick: grab your body and bury it in the backyard. summer you're responsible for your frat boy boyfriend. morty and rick nonchalantly drag their corpses off screen while beth, jerry, and summer stare at their corpses. 
rick  (o. s.) : c'mon! lets goooo! beth, summer, and jerry just stare at their corpses in disbelief as the music swells. 
[int. smith residence, garage - morning] 
morty enters. morty: hi rick, mom wants to know if you want breakfast. a red light surrounds the outline of the door frame. rick works away soldering. his watch vibrates, he looks at the face and sees the warning message 
government spy: rick looks over his shoulder, then holds the device he s working on like a bat. 
rick: yeah sure morty. look what i m working on. 
morty: okay. rick smashes the device into the side of morty s head, that sends him flying into the wall. 
rick: i know you re in there. 
morty: (screams) ahhh! what was that for? rick grabs morty by the hair and punches him super hard in the face. 
rick: get out of my grandson you bastard! morty s face bleeds. he tries to stand up, stumbles, falls over, and looks scared. what?! 
morty: it s me morty! under surveillancerick and morty 2. rick bends morty s arm behind his back, picks him up, then slams his face into the wall, and then into his work table, breaks glass, boxes, gadgets. 
rick: no it s not! don t worry morty, it ll be over soon! throws morty into the wall. 
rick: as soon as this bastard gets out of you! rick picks up a broken gadget, electricity flows out of it, wildly touches the ceiling, floor, then walls.

morty: ahhh! morty passes out. a white alien ghost falls out of morty. 
alien spy: we know you did it! you won t get away with it, just a few more days of evidence collecting and you re going away for a long long time. rick retrieves a gadget from within his lab coat. under surveillance rick and morty 
rick: not today scum. rick freezes the alien spy. smashes into tiny bits. it falls to the ground and morty starts to wake up, then rubs his head.

gromflamite officer: em, we ve lost another spy sir. gromflamite commander stands behind, slams his fist against the table. 
gromflamite commander: damn you rick sanchez! gromflamite commander paces back and forth. 
gromflamite commander: time to send in the next wave of spies and mercenaries. he points to the monitor. 
gromflamite commander: send in the micro spies. he ll not see them come. (evil laugh) under surveillancerick and morty 7. the gromflamite officer coughs and swivels on his chair to look at his commander. he then taps on the keyboard to enlarge surveillance of summer. then taps again to zoom in on her cheek. 
gromflamite officer: em sir, remember a few days ago we had a meeting to brainstorm ideas and talk about using our initiative? 
gromflamite commander: yes. it was a fruitful meeting from what i remember.

gromflamite commander: excellent officer. i ll promote you if this works. update my order to capture rick sanchez. gromflamite officer swivels back, and taps his keyboard. 
gromflamite officer: it s done sir. question sir. was sending the spies along with their families a good idea? gromflamite commander shakes his head. gromflamite commander i sense this isn t going to end well. you re for the firing squad if anyone dies. gromflamite officer gulps. a gromflamite artist slowly walks into the room, then holds up a wanted poster of rick. the head of the poster stateswanted for crimes against gromflamites, countless murders of our citizens, and the robbery of our treasures. (at the bottom of the poster) ps. he s also a dick. 
gromflamite artist: (teenage voice breaking) where do you want them?

rick turns on a transmitter. it emits a sound like radar and a white light pulsates. a universe hologram spirals out of the transmitter. he walks to the center, then accidentally kicks the empty suitcase that once carried the azzakari goods rick traded. 
rick: where are you, you window lickers? 
morty: window licker? 
rick: one braincell amoebas morty.

mercenary  (o. s.) : (laughs) he won t see this coming. under surveillancerick and morty 9. 
rick: bastard. rick pulls out his locator. 
rick: slick, trying to circumvent me by using a dimension where i don t exist. rick walks over to the wall and pulls down two levers. the walls and air simultaneously freeze with ice and tinge with electricity, as it pulls through the mercenary varpa from the other dimension. the mercenary varpa, a reptile that blends in with it s surroundings, wears a bullet chain and a sword on it s back. it s teeth start to rattle from the cold. 
rick: grab the rope morty. 
morty: okay rick. morty grabs the rope and creates a loop. then stands behind the mercenary as it s body fully materializes. 
rick: now morty! morty throws the rope around the mercenary. 
morty: got him!

rick: not you dummy. the gromflamites crawling around on your face. 
summer: (shrieks) ahhh get them off! a puff of smoke emanates from her face. 
[int. summer’s face - day] 
rick’s face hovers in the sky above summer. the light appears like the sun. the dirty magnifying glass resembles the moon. various gromflamites all run for their lives. under surveillancerick and morty screams fill the air and all buildings have been destroyed by fire and smoke. a gromflamite mother runs past with her baby. 
gromflamite mother: help me, my son isn t breathing! gromflamite soldiers help carry the injured gromflamites. 
gromflamite soldier: you re going to live, you hear me soldier!? 
injured gromflamite: tell my wife i love h... the injured gromflamite s limp body hangs in the arms of the gromflamite soldier s arms who screams as he looks skywards. 
gromflamite soldier: noooo! you ll pay for this rick sanchez. rick angrily shouts down at the micro spies. 
rick: listen up you fuckers. you re not taking me alive. get off my granddaughter, perverts. 
[int. gromflamites homeworld - day] 
a poor quality surveillance camera shows on the monitor. rick appears to laugh at the demise of the undercovergromflamites. 
rick  (v. o.) : ha ha ha you stupid fuckers. gromflamite commander smacks his fist into the table which knocks over a drink. 
gromflamite commander: he won t get away with this! bring me the eccledyke. gromflamite officer gulps. under surveillancerick and morty 
gromflamite officer: yes commander. 
eccledyke: (crafty suave french accent) gentlemen. eccledyke arrives, a black shadow that creeps along the wall, then the floor towards gromflamite commander. he smiles, his eyes glow, and teeth sparkle. a faint outline of long trend coat, trilby hat, and tie the only discernible features. 
eccledyke: you know my fee. 
gromflamite commander: dead or live, i want rick s body here. money is no barrier. 
eccledyke: as you wish.

rick slowly moves a knife towards summer’s face. 
summer: (terrified) grandpa, what are you doing? (closes eyes) please please please, please don t. 
rick: hold still summer, i m a scientist not a doctor. summer grits her teeth. rick gently touches summer s face with the knife, slowly presses the flat side of the blade on her cheek, and then scrapes the red pimple off her cheek. 
rick: done. summer opens her eyes. under surveillancerick and morty 
summer: done? rick sniffs the air.

jerry: what are we building? 
tafight stag: (grunts) temple. jerry raises his hand and shakes his head. 
jerry: i see. i think you have the wrong person, my skill-set isn t suited for this kind of work sir. tafight stag punches jerry.

waiter: yes sir. the waiter retrieves the menus, then walks off. morty looks outside and sees a blackhole within sight. 
morty: isn t this place a bit dangerous with that over there? 
rick: this is the last place they ll look, next to a blackhole. 
morty: you can t say that word anymore. 
rick: what, black? 
morty: no the other word. you know, ever since that racist leader said the s word. 
rick: i don t want to talk about it. i hate petty earth trivia where you can t say manhole or blackboard. science rules. if a leader doesn t believe in science, he s a fucking dumb loser. to be under surveillancerick and morty 
rick: honest, everyone s a loser. but more so him. fucking hate idiots. idiots everywhere, in charge, leaders, government, dumb flat earth conspiracies, assholes. rant over. 
morty: at least you can still say asshole. 
rick: you re right. they both laugh. a ginger hair blue alien catches rick s eye. she sits at the bar. 
rick: things are looking up. rick walks over to her, then taps her on the shoulder. she turns around. 
rick: (surprised) stormy staniels? 
stormy staniels: (surprised) rick?! thought you were dead. 
rick: i was, but that s another story. why are you here? (to the barman) i ll have the same.

[ext. planet mimic, screaming forrest - evening]

screaming forrest: ahhh! 
jerry: i don t like this place. 
screaming forrest: (evil laugh) we re going to eat you alive. jerry looks down. 
jerry: it s just a dream, they re not there. trees can t talk. a bird lands on a branch.

rick and morty sit in their booth with half-finished plates. morty appears to have a small red pimple forming on his cheek. rick picks up a knife. 
rick: morty, how long have you had that zit? 
morty: i m a teenager, i ve got lots of spots. what do you expect? rick leans over with the knife. 
rick: i ll be quick. exfoliate to exterminate spies. morty leans back, grabs a knife, then steps away from the booth. 
morty: i ll do it myself! under surveillancerick and morty 
rick: fine, suit yourself. he returns to his meal. 
[int. space station, pitstop cafe, bathroom - evening] 
morty looks into the mirror. a wanted poster of rick sanchez, placed next to the mirror, catches morty’s attention. oh no. 
morty: they have been here. morty sets the knife down, grabs the wanted poster, and takes a closer look. he then fumbles, drops the poster, leans down, and smacks his head off the sink basin. at the same time, morty s reflection doesn t move. the reflection s eyes look down at morty. morty slowly stands up whilst his reflection looks back. 
morty: what the fuck, not again. the reflection picks up the knife reflection . knife to it s neck. brings the it begins to cut into it s neck. morty s neck begins to bleed. he screams, throws the knife at the mirror, and smashes it. then runs out.

int. morty’s home - living room 
jerry is on the couch. summer is sitting on the other side of the couch. beth is in the armchair. morty is laying on the floor next to the couch. everyone is glued to their phones. rick enters the living room. 
rick: when s dinner? no one answers. jerry is watching a video on his phone of somebody else playing video games and commentating on it. 
rick: (to beth) hey beth, when s dinner? beth doesn t answer. she is watching a cat play with a ball of string. 
rick: can anybody hear me? no one answers. morty is watching a mr. poopy butthole cartoon on his phone. summer is texting. rick leaves the room and returns with a ray gun. shoots everyone s phones from their hands and they turn to ash in their hands. 
everyone: rick what the hell? 
rick: that will teach all of you for ignoring me. 
summer: i was texting my friends. 
jerry: i was watching a reaction video. 
rick: jerry why don t you try living life instead of watching somebody else react to one. oh yeah i forgot you re an unemployed loser. 
jerry: ha-ha rick. well guess what? because i m an unemployed loser you re going to have to buy us new phones now. so i guess the joke s on you. 
rick: whatever jerry, money is meaningless to me. beth when is dinner? 
beth: 7 00! 
rick: cool thanks. that s all i wanted to know. peace out! rick leaves the room. everyone sits in silence. 
beth: what are we supposed to do now? 
morty: he kind of has a point. we are constantly glued to our phones. jerry crosses his arms. 
jerry: morty, stop preaching to us and do something entertaining, please. everyone else crosses their arms and stares at morty. morty is reluctant, but starts self-consciously dancing for them. 1

[ext. - the phone store downtown] 
morty: man that sure was awkward. 
beth: for all of us. 
[int. - the phone store] 
morty: it sure is hard to be without a phone, i mean what would we do without it, you know? 
rick: yeah, you d have to exist in the real world for a few minutes, what a drag. the family is eager behind jerry to get their phones. rick lags behind, doesn t want to be there. 
jerry: hello, we re in a bit of a predicament. my father-in-law zapped our phones with a ray gun. does my insurance cover that? sales-rep, a young girl with glasses, behind the counter looks through the file on her computer. 
sales-rep: fortunately yes! 
jerry: wow, uh-that s lucky i guess. rick looks on suspiciously. 
rick: really? there s a ray gun coverage clause in the insurance agreement? 
sales-rep: fortunately yes! 
rick: hmm... sales-rep takes 4 new phones from the drawer. 
sales-rep: here are your new phones. everyone eagerly takes the phones and immediately begin scrolling. standing silently in the store. rick looks on suspiciously. he snatches the phones from their hands and puts them in a pile on the floor. he stomps on them until they are in pieces. 
everyone: rick! what is wrong with you? 
rick: something weird is going on here. 
jerry: (to the sales-rep) please excuse my father in law. we re pretty sure he has dementia. does my insurance cover stomping? 
sales-rep: (looking in the computer) fortunately yes! 
jerry: well, how bout that! sales-rep hands the new phones to jerry. rick is now super suspicious. 
jerry: today seems to be my lucky day. rick takes out his ray gun and blasts the woman in the face. she s launched back into the wall. the woman transforms into an alien with long orange tentacles right before their eyes. 
morty: oh my god rick! she s a alien. how did you know? 
rick: no day is jerry s lucky day. plus, insurance plans are inherently designed to screw you over. i knew something was off. give me your phone, jerry. 
jerry: what am i supposed to do? just stand here? 
rick: shut-belch-up. rick takes the phone and pulls a helmet from his pocket. the helmet has various color spectacles he can look through. rick cycles through them until he finds something interesting. 
rick: woah, that s weird. 
morty: what is it, rick? rick hands the phone to jerry. 
rick: here, go to town, jerry. jerry takes the phone. 
jerry: reaction videos here i come. rick watches through the lenses. 
rick: hmm, just as i thought. 
morty: what is it? 
rick: here put these bad-boys on morty. rick takes the lenses and pops them into a pair of sunglasses. morty takes the sunglasses and puts them on and looks at jerry. sees tentacles coming out from the phone and reaching up into jerry s eye sockets, sucking something from his skull. the phone then farts out an orange cloud-like jellyfish that floats out of the store and up into the sky. 
morty: oh my god! morty knocks the phone out of jerry s hand. the same thing is happening to beth and summer. he knocks the phones out of their hands as well. 
jerry: morty! what are you doing? i was watching poopie-pie 
beth: hey! 
summer: what are you doing, loser? 
morty: can t you see? 
rick: they can t see without the sunglasses, morty. 
morty: why? 
rick: it s like the movie they live morty, relax. we ve got to find out where that fart was going. come on! they take the phones from the family and run out of the phone store to rick s spaceship and fly off. jerry, beth and summer remain in the store and stare at the dead alien on the floor. 
beth: uhhh, we should probably go. 
[ext. rick and morty in the spaceship fly across the city.] 
in the houses they pass they see people attached to their phones, tentacles sucking from their brains. more orange jellyfish are flying up into the sky. 
morty: it s everybody rick, they re all having their brains sucked out. like mindless sheep! wake up sheeple! am i right? 
rick: you were one of them like 5 minutes ago, morty. i have a feeling this has been going on for a while. look, the farts are flying up into space. rick pulls the ship up into the sky and out into space. the blue sky fades to black. they follow the orange clouds up to the moon and fly around to it s dark side. there is a crashed alien ship. a conspicuous antenna sits atop, receiving the jellyfish clouds from all over earth. 
morty: it s aliens behind it all, rick. 
rick: yeah it s like a bad m. night shamalan movie. burp. 
morty: i think you mean any m. night shamalan movie. 
rick: ooh sweet burn morty! woop-woop! morty does the raise the roof dance. 
rick: raising the roof, nice one morty! 
morty: that s right. 
[ext. on the street - day] 
jerry, beth and summer are walking down the street. 
summer: i m bored. i can t believe grandpa rick just took off with all our phones and left us here. 
jerry: kids today, always glued to a screen. no idea what to do without one. he shakes his head and walks over to an opened window and stares inside. in the house a kid is playing video games. the kid stares over at jerry staring in through the window. 
jerry: continue... with some commentary please. summer and beth look at him in shame. 
beth: i m going to go and find a cat to watch. 
[int. alien ship] 
back on the moon, rick and morty land near the alien ship and make their way inside. cautiously they walk through the halls. in the various rooms viral videos are being made. 
rick: we ve seemed to have found the fountain of all internet garbage. they walk past the rooms. the aliens are filming cats playing with string. making memes. blogposts. instagram pictures of food and vacation scenery. one of the aliens is taking selfies-rick lifts his glasses and sees an attractive girl making a duck face. all the big internet celebrities are here. 
rick: i always wondered who made all this crap. i should have known it was aliens. no sane human would waste his time making this stuff for free. 
morty: i wonder how much of the content out there is actually these aliens. 
rick: maybe all of it, morty. in the next room an alien is cutting up videos to make gifs. 
morty: look rick, that s where they make the jifs. rick stops in his tracks. 
rick: woah, woah, woah. did you say jifs? 
morty: yeah, its a g, like in giraffe. jifs, you know. rick bursts into laughter. alien guards enter the hallway and hold them at gunpoint. rick continues laughing. 
rick  (to the guards) : he says jifs. all the guards begin to laugh. morty looks down embarrassed. 
morty: both are acceptable i think. rick uses the distraction to blasts the guards. he points out the window to the antenna. 
rick: we need to get to that antenna. 
[ext. morty’s home] 
beth is watching a cat sleeping on the front steps. she pokes it. 
beth: stop sleeping and do something funny. the cat runs away. beth sighs and enters the house and pours herself a glass of wine. int. morty s home 
summer is at the table stuffing letters into envelopes. beth enters. 
beth: what are you doing? 
summer: i m writing letters to my friends. you know, instead of texting them. 
beth: with snail mail? 
summer: yeah, its old-fashioned and romantic. 
beth: ugh, kids today. summer frowns and goes out to the mailbox and puts the envelopes in and sits down next to it, waiting for the mailman to come. after a few seconds she groans and takes out the letters and heads off to deliver them on foot. 
[int. the alien ship] 
they make their way through the alien ship’s corridors, shooting at the alien guards that are persuing them. rick shoots a fuel cell in the wall that explodes and takes out a group of aliens. 
[int. the alien ship’s engine room] 
they get to the room at the base of the antenna and it’s plugged into the ship’s engine. the squid creatures are sucked into an opening in the sattelite dish and are ground up into a liquid. the orange liquid fills up half of the tank, we can see through a glass window. 
morty: what is it rick? 
rick: it s the engine morty. it looks like the ship runs on brainpower of some sort. 
voice  (off screen) : that s precisely right. on the other side of the room is a chair with its back facing the duo. it turns to face them. a man with long, curly, black hair and sunglasses is sitting there. 
rick: howard stern? 
howard: none other. there was an african-american woman laughing on the side of the room, robin quivers. she s in a chair of her own. 
robin: (laughing) you re too much howard. 
morty: wait who s howard stern? do i need to know who this is for this reference? 
rick: he was a radio dj in the 90 s. he had the biggest show in the world and he called himself the king of all media. 
howard: i was the king of all media. robin laughs in the corner. 
morty: wait-what was his show about? 
rick: he would interview midgets and ask them if they had normal sized penises. 
morty: what? is that it? 
rick: pretty much. 
morty: that was the biggest radio show in the world? 
rick: it was the 90 s, morty, we didn t have many options. 
howard: when the aliens crashed here, the ai that operated their ship was destroyed. they took me so they could use the media that i was the king of to suck brainpower from the earth s population. is it any wonder smartphones came around just the same time that i disappeared from the public sphere? robin quivers laughs in the corner. 
rick: does she really laugh after everything you say? 
howard: more or less. 
robin: (laughing-covering her eyes) more or less... 
howard: for a small dopamine kick the aliens took micro bits of brainpower from the world s smartphone users. equal to 1 iq point from 100 people over the course of a year. over the course of time they became better and better at what they did, now all many people do is stare at their phones. 
rick: that s explains why the earth is inundated by idiots all of a sudden. 
morty: you ve got to stop this man, it s not cool to take people s brain power. 
howard: do you think anyone is missing it? the world is at peace for once. when people are staring at their phones there s no fighting. 
rick: whatever, do what you need to do. who am i to judge? how much more brainpower do you need to get out of here? 
howard: all of it. the alien guards come in. 
howard: take them away. the aliens handcuff rick and morty and take off their sunglasses. the orange, tentacled aliens turn to attractive internet celebrities. 
howard: wait! the guards pause. rick and morty turn. 
howard: (to morty) do you have a normal sized penis? rick looks over to morty, as if he s waiting for his answer. morty scratches his head uncomfortably. 
morty: ummm. 
[int. summer’s friend’s living room] 
back on earth. summer meets up with her friends at one of their houses. there are three teenage girls sitting in the living room, staring at their phones. summer is holding the letters, out of breath, her hair is messed up. 
summer: i didn t know where you guys were hanging out, so i had to go to all your houses first. how s it going? all her friends continue looking at their phones. 
summer: don t you think it s a little unhealthy to just stare at our screens all day? the girls roll their eyes and look up at each other. 
girl 1: what do you suggest we do then? 
summer: what if we do something not on our phones? you know, like in the real world. 
girl 2: like what? 
summer: we can go shopping. 
girl 3: that s what i was just doing. 
summer: well, what about the movies? 
girl 2: i m halfway through a movie right now. everyone sits in silence for a beat before slowly returning to their phones. 
summer: what are you guys gonna do all day then? 
friend 1: this. summer sighs and walks out, throwing her letters on the floor. 
summer: ugh, kids today! 
[int. alien jailcell] 
rick and morty are locked in an alien jailcell, their hands in handcuffs. they are sitting back to back. 
morty: i have a bad feeling rick. i don t think we can get out of here. 
rick: speak for yourself, morty. i ve still got my brain. they took my portal gun, but they left something even more powerful. reach in my pocket, nice and deep. morty reaches in hesitantly. 
morty: this isn t going to be like last time is it, rick? 
rick: man up morty, those weren t even my testicles. morty whines in anticipation. then he feels something. 
morty: it s a phone. 
rick: yeah, its my phone. morty hands it to him. 
morty: i didn t even know you had one rick. 
rick: that s cause i m not glued to it all the time, morty. that s why i still have my brains. rick turns on the phone and starts to look for something. 
rick: the guards examined it, but gave it back to me. they don t know it has inter-universal capability. there s a universe, morty, where they make viral videos so addictive they re weaponized. all they do is show them to the enemy and they re so transfixed, all they can do is watch until they die. i ll lure the guard over. pretend to be sick morty. morty begins to moan and rock back and forth. guard, who appears to be an attractive girl-an instagram celeb-comes to the cell and looks inside. 
guard: hey! quiet in there. 
rick: you ve got to check on my grandson. i think he s sick. you ve got to help me for the love of god. the guard sighs and enters. 
rick: ah bless you kind stranger, so heartwarming to know there s still good people in the universe like you. morty moans and continues rocking. 
guard: there doesn t seem to be anything wrong with him. 
rick: eat viral m f ! rick shoves the phone in the guard s face. a pulsating, flashing light, pooping pink bunny video begins to play. the guard is transfixed as her eyes turn to swirls. rick grabs the keys from the guard... 
rick: thank you very much.... and frees himself and morty. rick grabs his ray gun from the locker as well as the sunglasses. 
morty: i m surprised the whole pretending to be sick thing worked. rick is raiding explosives from the gun closet. 
rick: don t question it, burp, morty. morty looks at the guard just staring at the phone and feels bad for her. 
morty: rick we can t just leave her like this can we? 
rick: you re right morty. he blasts the guard. 
rick: i need my phone. he picks up the phone from the dead girl s hand. 
morty: rick! did you need to kill her? 
rick: geez morty, you didn t seem have a problem with it before when they were aliens. you better put these back on. rick hands morty the sunglasses. he puts them on and the guard turns back to an alien. morty relaxes. 
morty: what about you rick? 
rick: empathy was never really a problem for me... and it s more satisfying to shoot these internet celebrities to be honest with you. rick powers up his ray gun. 
[int. morty’s home- kitchen] 
beth is drunk in the kitchen, jerry comes in with a black eye. 
beth: what happened to you? 
jerry: apparently parents don t like when you watch their children through their windows. beth sighs, takes a gulp of wine and hiccups. 
jerry: are you drunk? 
beth: not enough. summer enters the kitchen. 
summer: my friends suck. 
jerry: what s wrong? 
summer: they re sucked into their phones. 
jerry: (to beth) you re father really screwed the pooch on this one. you re drunk, summer doesn t fit in with her friends anymore, i got punched in the eye and now i can t come within 50 yards of a school. it s settled, we can t live without our phones. 
beth: i hate to say it, but i think you re right. 
summer: the thing i don t get is, we all did the things we would normally do on our phones, but in the real world it made us losers. 
jerry: maybe we ve been trying to escape reality for too long and our phones were an easy escape. 
beth: so, what should we do now? 
jerry: face reality for once. they stand around silently for a moment. beth stares at her glass of wine, then at jerry. jerry sits down at the table and puts his head in his hands. summer stares out the window. 
summer: so what did you guys used to do to escape reality back before you had phones? they sit around the table and play monopoly. summer rolls a three. 
jerry: ohh, looks like somebody has to pay income tax. now isn t this exciting? rick and morty don t know what they re missing. 
[int. alien ship corridor] 
rick and morty are pursued through the halls of the ship by the aliens. rick is firing at the aliens and being fired upon. (director can decide on the choreography for this.) they climb towards the top of the antenna up a spiral staircase. morty pushes an alien out a window. rick is planting explosives throughout the staircase. the pursuing aliens are right behind them! 
rick: my ship will be waiting for us up top, morty. then we ll set this whole place to blow. they get to the top and there s a throne room. howard is there waiting for them. behind him is a giant screen. howard raises his arm and the aliens guards respectfully back away and leave them alone. 
howard: why do you resist? you re happiest when you are mindless creatures. i m only giving mankind what they want want. 
morty: you just can t take people s brains from them. 
howard: did we take them? it was all voluntary. you were so eager to escape reality you practically donated them to us. 
morty: it still doesn t make it right. people aren t living their lives. they don t talk to each other any more, they re zombies. 
howard: but they re at peace. take away their distractions and the world will fall apart. 
rick: he does have a point morty. 
morty: i can t believe i m hearing this. give me the detonator rick. i m ending this. morty tries to wrestle the detonator from rick. rick refuses to give it up. 
rick: morty, i don t want to die. 
morty: we have to save them rick, the sheeple. 
howard: you leave me no choice. now that we have the brain power of rick sanchez there s no need to take the rest from the humans. we ll suck out all of your iq and be on our way. behind howard the screen begins to play. it s the same weaponized gif from before that rick used on the guard. morty still is wearing his sunglasses so he can see the tentacles coming out from the screen towards them. 
morty: look away rick. rick s eyes are swirls in his head, he s mesmerized. 
rick: but it s so compelling. morty takes the detonator from rick s hands. morty is about to push the button. just then morty is shot with blue force lighting. we turn to see it coming from howard stern s fingers. morty writhes in pain on the floor, he cries out in pain. rick hears morty s suffering and is snapped out of his daze. 
rick: hey! no one electrocutes my grandson but me! he opens fire on howard. howard dodges the shot and fires the force lighting at rick. rick and morty are now both entwined in the blue electricity. they re writhing in pain on the floor. rick i m sorry morty. i should have let you blow us up. morty shut up rick. this is all your fault. rick you re right morty. i take the blame for this one. totally my bad. in the corner robin looks at the two suffering on the floor, then looks to howard stern, then looks to the two suffering on the floor, then to howard stern. she turns and picks up howard stern, the blue electricity surging through her body. she carries him over to a bottomless shaft and throws him down. he screams as he falls and explodes in a flash of blue light. the explosion starts a chain reaction which begins to blow up the ship. the building begins to rumble. rick and morty lean up. 
rick: you saved us! 
robin: it was the right thing to do. i ve been a sidekick for too long, watching from the sidelines. it was time i stopped the madness. 
(rick's ship pulls up to the window. rick and morty run and climb in. robin stands there at the window.) 
morty: get in, we have room. 
robin: it s too late for me now. 
rick: seriously, there s like a full seat just for you. 
robin: go back to earth, tell them what happened. lead them morty, lead them... 
morty: uh... okay... rick and morty fly off. robin stands in the window as the ship is exploding. she raises her fist in the air in a sign of peace. morty does the same. 
[ext. outerspace] 
rick and morty in rick’s space ship riding back to earth. they are silent for a few beats. 
morty: that electricity was weird was unexpected, wasn t it? 
rick: yeah that was really out of left field. 
morty: i mean, it wasn t even foreshadowed or anything. did he have any links to star wars or something? 
rick: no, not at all. not even a little. 
morty: so that wasn t, like, something we could have seen coming? 
rick: no, that was just plain old lazy writing. 
morty: (thoughtfully) huh. 
[ext. morty’s home] 
the ship lands outside the house, they hop out and walk inside. 
[int. morty’s home - dining room] 
jerry, beth and summer are having a good time, playing charades. jerry is pretending to be a monkey. 
beth: you re a monkey! 
jerry: bingo! you re on fire today beth. 
beth: well, you have been a monkey for every turn... rick and morty enter. 
rick: we re home. 
summer: where have you two been? 
morty: we found the place where they were making all the internet garbage and destroyed it. 
jerry: i hope you still have our phones rick? 
rick: i sure do. rick tosses the phones to everyone. they all cheer. 
rick: but, you might be a little disappointed. 
beth: no new content? 
jerry: but it s been over 3 hours. 
rick: told you. 
morty: what s going to happen, rick, now that there s nothing for anyone to look at on their phones? ("come on get happy"-by the partridge family begins to play) 
rick: we ll have to wait and see morty, we ll have to wait and see. (musical montage) the family is around the table for dinner. it s 7 00 and everyone is happy and laughing. we see around the world people looking at their phones, but there s no new content. 
[int. nice suburban home] 
a mother sits on the couch looking at her tablet. no new content. she puts it down and begins playing with her children. 
[int. messy apartment] 
a man sitting in a messy apartment in his underwear, looks at his phone. no new content - gets up and begins cleaning up. 
[ext. park] 
a fat man puts down his phone, gets up off a bench and begins to exercise. 
[int. apartment japan] 
a man sees no new content and goes to the bathroom and hangs himself. 
[int. house in the middle east] 
soldiers in the middle east see nothing new on their phones and begin shooting at the enemy. 
[int. fancy office] 
a ceo at a company sees nothing new on his phone and hits sell on his computer. we see newspaper headlines twirling towards the screen. stock markets crash! massive riots! lena dunham to host her own talk show! 
[int. white house] 
we see the us president look at his phone and no new content. he gets bored and presses the big red button on his desk. 
[int. kremlin] 
we see the russina president do the same thing. 
[ext. earth from outer space] 
nuclear warheads are launched across the globe and explode. the world is transformed into a post-apocalyptic hell-scape. 
[ext. morty’s home - the only building standing] 
[int. living room - the walls are busted and charred] 
the family is sitting in the remains of their home. everyone is dressed like they’re in mad max. 
beth: i feel so free, to be honest with you. i m not a slave to my phone anymore. 
jerry: see, that s what i was talking about there s nothing to fear by facing a little reality once in a while. 
rick: wow, jerry, you went straight from trying to escape reality to being delusional. i have to hand it to you, i m impressed. 
jerry: thank you rick. 
rick: it wasn t a compliment. fortunately there s a reality where none of this happened and the versions of us that lives there dreams of living in a post-apocalyptic hellscape. also, everything on the internet is normal, you know, like it s not aliens sucking our brains out through our eyes or anything. the rick there contacted me and said we can make the switch right now. 
morty: wow, that s pretty lucky, huh? 
rick: you said it, morty. rick shoots his portal gun and a portal appears. an exact replica of the family walks out, wearing their normal clothes. 
replica jerry: well, would you look at this kids! 
replica beth: it s just like mad max, just like we wanted. 
replica summer: look my replica has a sawed off shotgun! that s so badass. 
replica morty: we sure are lucky there were replicas of us that wanted out of here, huh, rick? 
replica rick: you said it replica-morty. a good post-apocalyptic hellscape is hard to come by. the original family says nothing. summer hands her replica the sawed off shotgun. the original family walks into the portal and is transported to the living room of their house. 
[int. living room] 
everything is back to normal. they see their replica’s phones sitting on the couch and hesitate for a moment, before sitting back down in the exact positions they began the episode in, except now they’re wearing mad max clothing. they begin to scroll, smiles appear on their faces. 
rick: what time is dinner beth? beth immediately looks up from her phone. 
beth: it will be at 7 00 dad. 
rick: i m glad you learned something, beth. i ll be in the garage. 
[int. smith residence, garage - afternoon] 
rick dips his face in a bowl of water. jerry enters, holds a playing card ripped in two. his focus remains on the card as he moves the smaller piece to where it tore off. 
jerry: rick, do you have something that would seamlessly repair a torn playing card without the seam showing? jerry looks up, eyes widen. 
jerry: what are you doing? exfoliating? are you rick stands up straight, grabs a towel, and dries his face. 
rick: jerry, if you re going to answer the question you ve just asked, what s the point in asking it? 
jerry: emmm, it s a guess. right? did i guess 
rick: get out. i m sciencing. what you want is magic. try the magic shop. 
jerry: (smiles) good idea. i will! jerry exits. rick walks over to a lever, and pulls it. 
rick: (relieved, rhetorical) thank god he s gone, how did he know? a laser shoots out from the attached device, pointed at the glass bowl. annie, returns back to normal, covered in water. she spits out water, wrings out her hair, and pants for air. 
rick: i don t feel any different. have you been up to? what rick looks in a mirror, points to a wrinkle. 
annie: your face is covered in bacterial monsters. i ve been running for my life! have you seen cyanobacteria up close? 
rick: yawn. my sphincter could do with a touch up. 
annie: i m not going anywhere near that hellhole. 
rick: cyanobacteria don t live around there. you need to finish the job. we re conducting science, don t you forget that. let me see the test results. annie hands rick the clipboard. 
annie: i m starving! it s been seven days. i only had rations for six. did you forget to give me enough or forget to extract me? she moves her hand over her stomach. rick pauses, rolls his eyes. 
rick: it was an oversight. science is full of oversights. that s why we have numerous trials. 
annie: i suppose. 
rick: i choose to overlook your indiscretions. and that s saying something coming from me. 
annie: do you want a medal? 
rick: i want you to do your job. rick flips through the paperwork. he shakes his head, and jots down comments next to test results. 
annie: i had to eat a meat crumb from the side of your mouth. i was so hungry. 
rick: are you sure these results are accurate? he looks at a chart, and writes the latest results. a line graph underneath trends downwards. pointing downwards. he draws a dash 
annie: we ll need to conduct more tests. he points to a red cross top of the graph, indicating where the trending line should be. 
rick: you d think!? it s looking that way. rick s mid-morning snack sits on top of the worktop. meat slices hang out of the overloaded sandwich. he slides the sandwich away from her. 
rick: look away. 
annie: i haven t eaten meat in over two years! and now i can t get the good times out of my head. 
rick: it tasted better than that fake substitute you call food. you re welcome. 
annie: you don t realize how long it took for me to become a vegetarian. i saw a hypnotist, all that time lost. i love meat so much; how it tastes, feels, and the memories. i m dying for a big sausage. 
rick: like a porn star, you can t live without it. you ready? 
annie: (rhetorical) why me? 
rick: you- 
annie: (interrupts) don t answer that. annie takes out a syringe from her pocket. 
annie: this isn t going to work. he returns back to the lever, rests a hand on it. 
rick: just stick it up there and we ll find out. 
annie: so disgusting. fine, let s do this. i don t know why you... rick pulls the lever. 
rick: (shakes head) women! too much talking. he rolls his finger along the floor, then puts his hand down his pants, maneuvers his finger. 
rick: that ought to do it. he sniffs his finger, then recoils his nose away. 
rick: woah, definitely. 
[ext. main street, joke shop - day] 
jerry looks through the window. an array of magic tricks entice customers. a ripped playing card advertises a product. jerry smiles, and enters. 
[int. magic shop, shop floor - day] 
the shop’s poorly lit, eerily quiet, and not a soul in sight. his footsteps echo the closer he gets to the counter. he rings the counter-bell. hello. 
jerry: is anybody here? the cash register sits open. dollar bills overflow. jerry s eyes stare at the money. 
jerry: strange. a puff of smoke engulfs jerry. he chokes. knocks the bell to the floor. stands back, and waves the smoke away. 
jerry: (slight panic) i haven t touched the money. please don t hurt me. his eyes squint, he rubs them. 
jerry: hello? the amazing jericole. suited and booted, who bears a striking resemblance to jerry; takes his top-hat off. 
amazing jericole: how may we serve your custom? jerry sheepishly takes out the playing card and torn piece and shows the amazing jericole. 
jerry: i see you have a product that can repair this in the shop window. how much? the amazing jericole picks up a small cover, walks over to a door, golden curtains either side, signage above the door states magic room. a freestanding sign next to the door states sign by entering this tunnel, you freely give up your soul to the devil, and in the good knowledge you have decided upon your fate. he drops the cover over the sign, and waves an arm to beckon jerry to enter. 
amazing jericole: we have such a product and many more. join us. and you ll discover the magic secrets of our trade. jerry raises an eyebrow. 
jerry: (curious) interesting. i ve never joined a club before. (ponders) hm, i ve never been allowed. can never pass those pesky entry exams. jerry enters. 7. 
[int. magic shop, corridor - day] 
he walks down the unlit tiny corridor. 
jerry: (hesitant) it s a little dark don t you think? the amazing jericole follows, and carries a lit candle. the flame s light bounces shadows off the uneven walls. 
jerry: i m not sure about this. 
[int. magic shop, magic room - day] 
jerry enters, stops, and looks around. the amazing jericole opens his arms wide. 
amazing jericole: welcome. the room appears as a large spacious warehouse. various circus performers and magician assistants practice in all corners of the room. circus performers hang from the ceiling. magicians practice their tricks with various success. a magician cuts an assistant in half with a chainsaw, blood splatters everywhere, he scratches his head, and the legs kick. 
magician: strange, didn t think we were using blood. 
magician assistant: (panics) ahhh! what have you done?! 
amazing jericole: this wonderful labyrinth is your new home jerry. jerry surveys the area. 
jerry: (surprised, happy) david copperfield, blaine, dynamo, so cool. this place is awesome! can t wait to tell beth. michael carbonaro, 35, dressed as a shop assistant, approaches jerry, with outstretched hand. 
michael: welcome, jerry. that elated high you re feeling. that s the carbonaro effect in action. jerry s eyes dart to michael s name tag on his shirt. 
jerry: you know what michael, i thought it was.

beth: what repair kit? he never fixes anything here. he just asks me or dad. dad, have you seen him? rick farts again. 
rick: what is she doing? more than usual. i m farting he grabs his ass, and fondles. a squeak of a fart escapes. 
beth: what? you always fart and burp. it s what happens when you re elderly. 
morty: yeah, you re one windy person rick. summer covers her nose. 
summer: oh god, it s a bad one. there s leakage. i m sure

amazing jericole: the amazing jericole at your service. what delight would you like to purchase? beth shows the amazing jericole the flier. 
beth: where s my husband, where s jerry? the amazing jericole looks straight at beth, whilst his hands produce magic. 
amazing jericole: he s in rehearsals. you ll see him perform later. 
beth: tell him he better be paid this time. he smiles. 
[int. smith residence, garage - day] 
morty stands on an invisible platform created by a circular device, which is center of the room. his body slowly moves up and down. 
morty: what s this gadget rick? morty tries to lick an ice lolly quickly before it melts. the lolly drips on the device, interfering with the electrics. rick kneels down and inspects the device. 
rick: it s a force field, morty. 
morty: cool. 
rick: your father has a habit of finding his way into my stuff. 
morty: yeah. surprised he found the interrogation room. he was stuck there for days. 
rick: he s a pest. gets into all your shit. breaks it. i ve got to create child proof locks for an adult. beth enters. she holds up the flier. 
beth: (annoyed) look what you ve done dad. you told jerry to go to that magic shop, and now he s a magician. rick stands up and grabs the flier. 
rick: he s a what? that man can t even cook an egg. it just goes to show. 
beth: show what? 
rick: he s weak and susceptible to influence. at least he has a job now. 
beth: (calm) that s a good way to look at it. morty gets off the device. 
morty: i think it s cool. 
rick: (angry) science is cool! magic is for the moment. for dumb minds that can t see magic for what it is. 
morty: what s that? morty looks at rick, stands still, lolly melts over his fingers. 
rick: for..... rick sees morty s innocence. 
rick: it s nothing morty. forget about it. summer enters. 
morty: can we go? 
summer: go where? rick gives summer the flier. 
beth: your father s performing this evening. 
summer: (speaks slowly) oh my god. he s not. 
morty: he is. i m going to be so popular in school. 
summer: so cool. at least i can tell my friends i ve got a dad. 
rick: it s not what you want morty. it s a fad. your friends next week will be onto the next fad. they ll forget about you and jerry. i won t forget. we could go on a mystery journey instead. morty takes the flier from summer. 
morty: hold that thought rick for next week. i can t remember when i was this excited to go out. rick crosses his arms, grumbles. beth hugs her children. 
beth: awww. it s been so long since we had family time. 
[ext. sebono theatre - evening] 
morty, summer, beth and rick stand outside. a huge queue of people waits in line. posters show jerry and two beautiful assistants on stage. beth looks at the poster. 
beth: (cross) who are those two? 
summer: not jealous mom? dad would never ever leave you or let himself get involved with another woman. 
beth: they re so pretty, young. i m old, ugly. 
summer: dramatic. mom, it s just magic. don t read too much into the poster. you re beautiful. when i m as old as you, i wish i could look as good as you. beth hugs summer. 
beth: thank you, summer. that s the loveliest thing i ve heard all day. 
rick: for what it s worth sweetie, that man will never leave you, he s an annoying leech, and all up in your business. rick farts again. 
rick: geez. he grabs his butt. 
rick: it s getting worse, not better. the experiment s a failure. 
beth: thanks dad. i m being self conscious at the moment. i don t know why. tina coote, 14, dressed as if she s 20, stands behind morty in the queue. 
tina: is that you morty? morty turns around. 
morty: (unsure) oh hi, em, tina. to the big show? looking forward 
tina: damn right, the best thing this shit town has ever done. rick interjects. 
rick: (protective) who are you? why are you talking to my grandson? 
tina: tina coote. we share a class in school. 
rick: you re dressed like a hooker. what kind of name is that? sounds like a dumb name. are you a dumb person? no! 
tina: how rude. 
rick: dumb answer. (to morty) i m not speaking to this dumb person. why do you associate yourself with these types of people morty? rick turns his back on tina. 
morty: i don t. she s just a random student i can barely remember. 
tina: (sarcastic) nice. 
rick: certainly random. 
[int. sebono theatre - evening] 
morty, summer, beth and rick sit center; a few rows from the front. summer takes her phone out and types away. the amazing jericole holds a mic. 
amazing jericole: ladies and gentlemen, you re in for a real treat. we have the best magician i ve found in decades. he ll twist your mind into knots. he ll amaze you, dazzle you, take your breath away. i present the stupendous smith. the amazing jericole clicks his fingers and disappears. jerry appears where the amazing jericole once stood. his two assistants either side of him, hold out their arms, presenting the stupendous smith. jerry can t see the audience, blinded by the stage lightening. beth takes a deep breath. 
beth: what in the hell? more beautiful. they re even rick slouches in his seat. 
rick: why did i come to this shit show? stupid smith more like. 
morty: quiet rick, the shows about to start. jerry holds up his arm, clicks his fingers, an orb appears in front of him, floats there. 
morty: whoa. the audience all react, clap, gasp, and cheer. jerry smiles, pinches the side of his assistant s waist, signals her to grab his props. beth s face drops. 
beth: (angry) hey, what s he doing? the assistants return, one carries a small table, the other a box of tricks. jerry grabs the box, dumps the contents on the table, and hands the box back. the contents are neatly arranged into the four corners of the table. 
morty: wow, how d he do that? 
rick: tidy micro-bots. simple. jerry grabs three cups and a ball. places a ball under one cup, disappears, reappears under another cup. lame. 
rick: slight of hand. jerry grabs a bowl of water, and cracks an egg. a gold fish falls into the bowl. 
rick: staged. the audience claps. rick looks over his shoulder. 
rick: you re all fucking gullible. jerry grabs a page from a newspaper, rips it into four pieces, holds each piece behind each other, and gives it a shake. throws his arms open, and holds the reformed page. 
morty: cool. 
rick: it s another page, more slight of hand. how original. a trolley dolley walks down the aisle, and pushes a cart of food and drink. she s extremely overweight, the once tiny outfit has been stretched to it s limits. her flesh pokes through the gaps of her clothing, breasts overflow. 
trolley dolley: get your popcorn, dogs, beers here. rick looks over. 
rick: yikes! they ve really relaxed the standards here. that s an advert to stay away from junk food! summer looks over. 
summer: wow! that outfit has had a tough life. rick looks back towards jerry. summer returns to her phone. jerry grabs a deck of cards. he shuffles them. then throws them at the audience, who look away, except rick. summer hasn t noticed. she plays on her phone. but the cards disappear. 
morty: awesome. 
rick: nothing happens, literally. jerry grabs the box from his assistant, flips it again, and hands the box back. the cards have returned, neatly center of the table. 
morty: he s so good. 
rick: no he s not. 
morty: how s that orb ball thing still floating there? 
rick: he s using technology, not magic. 
morty: whatever. jerry clicks his fingers. his assistants return, remove the table and contents. before they leave, they each give jerry a peck on the cheek. 
stage assistant: (whispers) you were amazing, stupendous in fact. 
jerry: (chuffed) i know, right. beth stands up. 
beth: (shouts) what the hell was that?! get away from my husband you home wreckers! grabs summer s phone, throws it at an assistant, hits her head, knocks her off balance, drops the box. 
[ext. stage, magic box - evening] 
tiny human-like aliens with slug-like eyes protruding from the top of their heads, dressed in overalls, run away. 
alien: we re exposed, run for it! 
[int. sebono theatre, stage - evening] 
jerry approaches the orb. his hand hoovers a foot underneath it. 
jerry: and for my final trick, this orb will return back to my hand. he clicks his fingers, the orb drops. jerry holds the orb up, moves closer to the audience, showing them no wires are attached. 
jerry: as you can see, nothing is attached. pure magic. the audience stands up, they all clap, cheer, whistle, stamp their feet. 
audience: stupendous, stupendous, stupendous. 
rick: stupid, stupid, stupid.

jerry parks his two seater sports car in the drive. beth, morty and rick all look out the window. 
rick: that guy is seriously overcompensating. jerry gets out, whistles as he approaches the front door. beth holds a smartphone. 
beth: everyone leave, we re going to argue. 
rick: perfect timing, i m so hungry. rick, morty and summer exit. jerry enters. 
jerry: hi honey i m home! 
beth: don t you honey me. 
jerry: huh? beth holds up the smartphone. 
beth: you ve forgotten your phone, again! jerry shrugs. 
jerry: that old thing. jerry takes out his brand new shiny smartphone, encrusted with gold and diamonds. 
jerry: i upgraded. beth reads the text message left on the locked screen. 
beth: you were out of this world. you can make my virginity disappear anytime. (pauses) you forgot to transfer your number, you idiot. who is she, is she that slut of an assistant? 
jerry: i ve no idea who you re talking about. i ve only got your number, the kids, some new guy i made friends with down at the recycle bay, who i can t quite remember right now, and rick s number. that s it. honest. scouts honor. jerry tries to do his scouts honor hand sign to the best of his knowledge, but can t quite figure it out. 
[int. smith residence, kitchen - evening] 
morty walks over to the fridge. summer sits down. rick stands at the door. the muffled sounds of beth and jerry penetrate the thin walls. 
morty: aw geez, they re going to separate again. morty grabs a drink, closes the fridge door. 
summer: relax morty, they argue like this once a year. 
morty: i don t know, this seems more serious. rick grabs a device from within his jacket. attaches it to the door, it expands, unravels, a speaker and miniature satellite open up. 
jerry  (v. o.) : i ve only got.... rick walks over to the fridge. 
summer: there he goes again, same old.... 
rick: shush you two. 
jerry  (v. o.) :... rick s number. rick spits out the sandwich.

morty: shush rick. rick grumbles. 
beth  (v. o.) : what was that tonight? those sluts kiss you. you let 
jerry  (v. o.) : they re assistants. where s this coming from? i m a magician, it was all entertainment. nothing more than that. 
beth  (v. o.) : where have i heard that before? jerry s phone receives a text. 
beth  (v. o.) : who s that? is that text from one of your mistresses? 
jerry  (v. o.) : no one has my new number. know who it is. i don t 
beth  (v. o.) : i forbid you from working with those women again. any woman in fact. 
morty: this is wrong. we shouldn t listen in. 
summer: shut up morty, i m trying to listen. 
jerry  (v. o.) : there s nothing going on between me and those assistants, i love you. i always love, and will never stop loving you. from now on, i work on my own. 
[int. smith residence, living room - evening] 
jerry magically makes flowers appear from underneath his armpit. 
jerry: hope you love them. beth smells them. 
beth: aw, jerry, i do. i m sorry. 
jerry: i m sorry too. 
[int. smith residence, kitchen - evening] 
rick: ugh, makes me sick. rick packs the device away. 
rick: so close beth. shame. 
morty: that s a good thing, rick. i don t want them to break up again. rick rolls his eyes. boring. 
rick: i m off-ski. rick exits. 
summer: wait up. summer and morty follow. 
[int. smith residence, living room - evening] 
beth and jerry sit on the couch holding hands. rick sits, looks away. 
rick: oh god, i think i m going to be sick. rick gags. summer and morty sit. jerry smiles, content in his happiness. 
jerry: so kids, what did you think of your old man? 
summer: emmm, morty, the question was aimed at you. 
morty: you were amazing dad. 
jerry: you mean stupendous. 
rick: jesus jerry, take the compliment, stop with the semantics. 
jerry: (to rick) what did you think of the show? 
rick: that shit show charlatans perform for the gullible. it s not magic, it s slight of hand bullshit and technology disguised as magic. jerry s smile disappears. 
jerry: (angry) i do not use technology. just jealous. you re 
rick: jealous? jealous? why you dumb piece of shit. you use the same magic as everyone else and expect me to clap for the same tricks used by your peers? if you want me to respect you, be original. your magic is so easy even morty can do it. 
morty: i can? see! 
rick: morty knows it. 
jerry: if you think you can do it, replicate my last trick. 
rick: thought you d never ask. rick exits. returns back. rick holds his hand up, his palm towards the ceiling. 
rick: i m holding up an invisible orb. you can t see it because it s using reflective light. he clicks his fingers, the orb appears. 
rick: it reacts to high pitched sounds, and now you can see it. he spins it, lets go, the orb remains on the spot. 
rick: as you can see, it floats. i spun it. you can t see that. looks impressive morty doesn t it? don t be fooled by this, it s just technology, pretty inexpensive off the shelf walmart quality tech. impressed jerry? 
jerry: hmmm, you could pass for a magician using your pseudoscience. 
rick: you cheeky bastard. 
jerry: make it fly. rick exhales, rolls his eyes. 
rick: honestly, beth, i ve no idea how you live with this man-made disruptive slack-jawed human. i was getting to it jerry! rick clicks his fingers. the orb flies around the room. 
rick: it uses a preset flight path. and also contains sensors to prevent it from bumping into objects. the orb returns to rick, lands in his hand. he lets rip one of his finest farts. 
rick: ta-fucking-da. magic. beth covers her nose. dad! 
beth: gross. summer covers her nose. 
summer: oh my god, so smelly! i m surrounded by death smog. she coughs. 
summer: it s worse than morty s room in the morning. 
morty: (to summer) hey! (to rick) but how can dad prove his magic is real if you don t believe any of it from the beginning? 
beth: good question son. 
jerry: that was very a good question son. 
summer: am i missing something here? 
rick: real magic is the impossible. the how can it ever happen magic. like turning one object into another without using slight of hand. without using technology. turning water into ice using your hands. make fire out of thin air. cook an egg using your hands. use your imagination. 
jerry: you re thinking of sorcery. don t do hocus pocus. i 
rick: you don t do magic. 
jerry: i ll make you a believer. 
rick: i m waiting. jerry stands up, looks at rick, looks to the ceiling, ponders, then paces back and forth. 
rick: still waiting. 
jerry: i m thinking, don t rush me! jerry stops, looks at rick, clicks his fingers. 
jerry: got it. jerry ushers rick to stand up by using his hands. 
jerry: i ll need you to stand up. rick farts again, this time the sound of help can be heard, as if carried down a large cave, echoing. thunder and lightening shake the fixtures and fittings of the room. the amazing jericole stands at the window. hands clasped together. fingernails pointy. a circular medallion and a snake around it s edge, surrounds a five pointed star with the eye of horus center. his smile turns evil. 
rick: o-kay. jerry puts his index fingers to his temple, closes his eyes. a moment later, opens them, clicks his fingers. annie magically reappears, expanding rick s pants. her once clean outfit has been stained mahogany color. 
rick: (shocked) shit! how the hell? 
annie: (relieved) oh my god i m alive! 
morty: wow, stupendous smith in the house. dad, you re the best. 
jerry: (elated) thanks, son. 
summer: amazing. 
beth: didn t see that coming.

rick: fat stacks and dead presidents bitch! 
morty: geez rick, we gotta save her!

morty: that s not true rick. she hugged me today, and i felt something. there was something there, something real. morty blocks the tv. 
rick: come on morty, don t be that guy.

rick: that s messed up on so many levels. is it incest? clonecest? i-i don t even know morty! 
morty: okay i get it. can we go rescue jessica now? rick takes out his memory-wiper gun and configures it. 
rick: here. this is a memory-wiper. i ve configured it to erase any neurotransmitters having to do with morty. if you shoot jessica with this, it ll undo her brainwashing by making her forget everything about you. and probably this place as well. watch this. he shoots giant head jessica with the memory-wiper. she pulls away from slimy cancer morty. 
giant head jess: who are you? 
slimy morty: what re you talking about? giant head jessica coughs up slime. she looks at slimy morty in horror and throws up. geez.

pimpin  rick: wow, that s a new low even for you. 
rick: oh really? you re one to talk. 
pimpin  rick: what? would you rather me shoot them in head? 
rick: i don t know, it sounds pretty favorable compared to a humiliating life of pleasing infinite versions of my sex-obsessed grandson. 
pimpin  rick: look rick, all we do is reprogram their neurotransmitters, something life does to us all the time. what difference does it make if this chaotic, meaningless universe programs a jessica, or we do? 
rick: is that how you justify making a colony of brainwashed, sex-slaved, under-aged girls? 
pimpin  rick: what about unity? 
rick: that was completely different and you know it. 
pimpin  rick: because of us, they re finally happy. why would you fuck with that?

whip jess: he actually didn t bubble that one. she coughs, choking violently on her own blood. morty and jessica watch. man, we should, oh, geez, oh--whip jess gurgles and stops moving. her face turns purple. geez... morty. 
[int. pimpin’ rick’s lab - night] 
rick and jerry are strapped to their chairs, with a clockwork orange-like headpiece stretching their eyes open. in front of them is a screen showing pictures of jessica and the word“obey.” 
jerry: make it stop, please! 
rick: what is this, a clockwork orange? i bet you re gonna have me drink some obscure british drug milk too. no. 
head.  jess  (o. s.) : head jess dumps out a glass of milk. 
rick: do you really think morty s gonna love a psychopath like you? 
head.  jess: he already loves me, i could see it in his eyes. 
rick: that s it, when i get out of here, i m literally blowing up the place. i m gonna get on that computer and--head jess pours shampoo on rick s head. she washes his hair with her fingers. are you literally brainwashing me? wh-what is that, some chemical that ll seep into my head and force me to do whatever you ask? 
head.  jess: (genuine) no, it just relaxes me. she keeps washing. she hiccups. 
rick: are fucking kidding me? morty and jessica bust into the lab. they see rick and jerry strapped to the brainwashing chairs, and head jess next to them. morty, you gotta kill this bitch! head jess points a laser gun at rick. 
head.  jess: move, and they die. 
morty: put it down, jessica. 
head.  jess: you know, maybe i should just kill them now. i ll start with jerry. she points her gun at jerry--but head jess is blasted by lasers. igor morty comes out, screaming, and shoots her until she s dead on the ground. 
rick: thank god, she was getting on my nerves. literally. (he twitches) igor morty helps rick and jerry out of the chairs. fart morty? 
igor morty: that s igor morty to you. igor looks at jerry, who nods in approval. 
rick: okay. before we go i gotta do something. rick runs to pimp s desk. he types some commands. he fidgets with the computer and builds a simple remote with a lone, red button. he looks at the computer. a red screen displays self-destruct planet jessica? 
igor morty: (to jerry) will i ever see you again? 
jerry: you don t need to. they hug. 
morty: can we go now? 
rick: sure morty, whatever you say. rick zaps open a portal. igor waves goodbye as they leave. the portal closes. igor hears a beep. he walks over to pimp s desk and sees the red self-destruct screen. oh geez. 
igor morty: he tries typing, but a wall of code pops up. a few jessica s enter the lab. hey do you guys know how to code? they ignore him, looking at head jess s dead body. 
jess  1: if she s dead, who s the leader? jess 2 cracks her knuckles. i am. 
jess  2: they start fighting. igor morty watches in horror as we hear bones break. igor morty holds back vomit. 
[ext. jessica’s house - night] 
rick and jerry watch from the sidewalk. morty, still wearing the gimp suit, stands with jessica in front of her house. morty. 
jessica: she leans in to kiss him. he stops her. 
morty: no jessica, it s not real. rick pulls out his self-destruct remote. 
jessica: i don t care morty. i don t give a shit anymore. brainwashed or not, it doesn t make a difference. all i know is that i want you. if i had you by my side, i could be happy. isn t that what matters? that i m happy? it shouldn t matter how or why. the feeling is there. (beat) i love you morty. 
[int. pj reception area - night] 
planet jessica is in chaos. fires burning. jessica’s rebelling. wild morty’s running around half-naked. jessica(?), the only one with her hair down, walks sadly through the chaos. a giant head jess runs past jessica(?), pushing her out of the way. jessica(?) trips and rick’s silver pin falls out of her shirt. 
[ext. jessica’s house - night] 
j-9a stares into morty’s eyes. she leans in. morty lets her kiss him. rick looks down at his remote. he puts it away. morty pulls away from “jessica.” she looks truly happy. he shoots her with the memory-wiper. she stands there, confused. 
jessica  (j-9a) : who are you? 
morty: we re lab partners, remember? see you at school tomorrow. 
[int. pj reception area - night] 
our jessica holds her silver pin to her chest. tears fall from her face. igor morty runs up to her. 
igor morty: the station s gonna blow up! do you know how to code? 
jessica: (like a computer) mac or windows? 
igor morty: worse, linux. 
jessica: get me to a terminal. 
[ext. jessica’s house - night] 
“when the sun hits” by slowdive plays as morty walks towards rick and jerry. they all look at each other, not knowing what to say. jessica (j-9a) watches them, confused. they walk down the street. jerry pats morty on the shoulder. rick pulls out his self-destruct remote again and pushes the button. 
[ext. space, outside planet jessica] 
planet jessica sits there... and doesn’t blow up. 
[int. pimpin’ rick’s lab] 
igor morty stands with our jessica behind pimp’s computer. she wears her silver pin proudly. igor morty grabs jessica and kisses her. she pushes him away. she looks off into the distance and holds back tears. 
[int. auditorium - day] 
(a poster shows igor morty with jessica and says, new planet jessica, by the jessica's, for the jessica's)
(a crowd of jessica's cheer. our jessica holds hands with igor morty, waving to the crowd. she fakes a smile through her sadness.) 
[int. pj reception area - years later] 
now older, igor morty talks with jessica. it turns into an argument, like a couple that’s been married too long. 
[ext. planet jessica entrance - years later] 
igor morty, even older, takes out a small locket and opens it, revealing a photo of jerry. he gets into a space car. jessica, even older, runs out, but she’s too late. he flies away. 
[int. pj reception area - years later] 
jessica looks at her silver pin. she imagines morty’s face. our morty. all hope fades from her face. 
[int. planet jessica - time lapse] 
we see a time lapse as jessica walks through the resort. she gets even older. the resort loses color and starts turning grey. only a few old jessica’s are left, limping on canes. our old jessica gets in the elevator. 
[int. pimpin’ rick’s lab - far future] 
(old jessica walks through the lab -- it looks like no one's been inside for 50 years. she limps to pimp's computer. she types until a red screen appears; self-destruct planet jessica?)
(she moves her fingers over the keyboard. takes a breath. pushes the button. we cut to black as the song continues.) 
[int. morty’s room] 
jerry tries helping morty out of his gimp suit. 
jerry: i think this goes there-- 
morty: but doesn t that-- 
jerry: i don t think so, what if you--ow! geez--morty 
jerry: sorry, sorry. beth watches from the doorway. hey guys. beth 
morty: oh geez, mom, it s not--geez. 
beth: there s a--there s a zipper. right-- 
jerry: right where? 
beth: right there. she points at morty. 
morty: right where? 
beth: your--your butt. jerry sees a zipper near morty s taint. morty tries reaching for it. 
jerry: do you think-- 
morty: it s too--this thing is too tight. 
beth: here, let me help-- 
morty: no! 
jerry: i m going to help my son damnit! okay. fine. she leaves. 
jerry: here goes nothing, am i right? 
morty: ha ha, yeah. jerry grabs the crotch zipper. 
[int. morty’s classroom - day] 
mr. goldenfold is addressing the class of students, including morty and jessica. 
goldenfold: so, due to the current political whirlwind,--i miss you, obama--we are keeping students in the know with a class on politics. of course, due to lack of funding--i miss you, obama--i am required to teach this class despite my considerable lack of knowledge in this area. now, don t worry, students, this learning will be as unbiased as possible. my own political leanings, which are of course correct, will not come into play at all. so, to start, can anyone tell me what a democracy is? no students raise their hand. morty. one. how about you? this is an easy 
morty: umm, gee. is it where we re told we have like, y know, freedom and stuff? but really there s some rich people that control everything and make everyone work in jobs they hate, and stuff, and pay loads of money to billionaires. 
goldenfold: very good, morty. i see you ve been watching cnn. and can anyone tell me what a dictatorship is? no students raise their hand. jessica? 
jessica: it like originated in russia and korea and all those other countries. the government watches what you look at on the internet and stuff. although they do that here now too.. what? 
morty: oh man, really? big time. 
jessica: they see everything. morty looks horrified. 
[int. morty’s house - day - a little later] 
summer is sitting on the couch, texting. watching the news on tv. morty is 
morty: um, s-summer. can the government see what i look at on the internet? 
summer: (without looking up) um, yeah. they can now that we have an orange turd in charge. we re going to end up as some, like, suppressed dictatorship nation. they catalog everything; mark zuckerberg spies on people... i would delete your search history if i were you. 
morty: oh, geez. i mean, what else happens in a dictatorship? can they read minds? 
summer: lots of crazy, evil stuff goes down, morty. they make you join the army, and you re not allowed alcohol and stuff. rick enters swigging from his flask. 
rick: don t talk crap, summer. in most other galaxies, dictatorships are the way forward. our stupid, arbitrary earth politics and elections are a waste of time--anyone who votes is a jackass. jerry walks past wearing a sticker that says i voted. 
summer: well, how come dictatorships work in other galaxies and not on earth, grandpa rick? 
rick: they just do. some places have it sweet. there s a planet that s run by this. surfer dude and it s like, y know, (burp) a paradise or whatever. 
summer: but aren t all the civilians enslaved by the government; denied freedom; overworked; scrutinised beyond comprehension; and just completely miserable? 
rick: summer, would you stop asking so many stupid questions; it s really not a good use of my time to answer them. (burp) they re not enslaved, they re all living in like their own palaces and shit. 
morty: wow. palaces? that sounds great. we don t have palaces here (beat) do we? 
rick: not palaces like these ones. these palaces. oh, boy he looks into the distance, fondly. 
summer: can we go and see one? 
morty: yeah, rick. it would be, like, educational or something. 
rick: well, normally i would relish anytime not spent taking my grandkids on an inter-galactic educational tour, particularly a political one. but, listen, i ve been looking for something to do today. (sighs) screw it. rick shoots his portal gun at the wall, the green portal appears and the three of them step through it. 
[ext. dudetatorship planet - day - continuous] 
they step out onto a beautiful, sunny planet with giant, golden palaces. the floor is sand; there’s an abundance of trees. the public transport system is a giant skateboard.. the civilians of the planet (dudes) -- who are top half human, bottom half octopus -- all smile and wave at one another. they wear shorts and t shirts and look very relaxed and happy. their tentacles wiggle around from underneath the shorts. there are robot women wearing bikinis, zooming around on wheels. 
morty: gee, rick. this place looks really nice. ev-everyone s happy and stuff. it s not like earth at all. 
summer: (referring to robot-women) i m not okay with this obscene objectification of the female form. is it that men... why a group of attractive, male surfers, surfing on thin air, glide by them. summer stares in awe, giving a flirty wave. 
morty: what is this place, rick? 
rick: it s planet dude, run as a dudetatorship by emperor dude--also known as the dudetator . it s basically a regular dictatorship, but ran by just an all round chilled out dude. (beat) he s a bit of a c--an intrusive rumbling sound renders him inaudible. a giant, guitar-shaped spaceship lands in front of them. the door slams opens and out steps a california surfer dude type--think otto from the simpsons crossed with owen wilson--long, blonde hair, swim shorts, shirtless, shark tooth necklace, etc., but his bottom-half is also octopus-like. 
dudetator: rick, my man. so good to see you again. what brings you to the dudetatorship realm on this fine, fine day? rick has his arms folded and looks unenthusiastic. 
rick: yeah whatever. i m just teaching my stupid grandkids about intergalactic politics or something.. 
dudetator: well, you ve come to the right place, man. we love politics here, dude. this is the freest place in all the land... the dude gestures to his kingdom. a sign on a store-front reads back, sack, and wax your boards here. street lamps are shaped like women s legs in fishnet-stockings. ... the most gnarly kingdom in the galaxy. you come and go as you please. every dude has their own palace, their dream spouse--any woman they can imagine, man (beat) any--and their own butler. he ll bring you your favourite meal anytime; day or night. he ll even get you off if you fancy a break from that dream spouse of yours. he winks at rick. plus, no one has to work or pay taxes. it s a paradise. it really is. a robot butler dressed in swim shorts and baseball cap rolls up on a robotic skateboard. he hands morty a burger and summer a cocktail. 
morty: gee, th thanks, mr. dudetator. 
summer: (flirty) thank you, mr. dudetator. love your kingdom. i 
dudetator: well, my kingdom loves you, earth girl. follow me and i ll get you guys set up in the guest-palace. we re still thinking of a better name for it. (to robot butler) harry, make a note palace de guest . they begin walking down the street. a group of half-octopus, half-human kids splash around in the water of a fire hydrant--yet the water isn't water, it s soda. a car drives by with a marty mcfly looking dude hanging off the back, riding a surfboard. 
rick: (hushed) listen, morty, we re not staying long, ok? we ll just take a look around, i ll. hook up with that dream spouse he mentioned and then we ll head out. (to dude) hey, dude. who s a guy have to blow to get his dream spouse around here? 
dudetator: haha. i ve got you covered, my man. you want becky or zoe today? (beat) who am i kidding. the dude presses a button on his electronic device and, out of nowhere, two attractive robot women roll up to rick. they link arms with him, leading him away. 
robot girls: come with us, mr. sanchez. cut to 
[int. yoga studio - day] 
jerry, beth, and a class of women are sprawled out on yoga matts doing the downward facing dog. there is an attractive female instructor, claire, at the front of the class. jerry and beth are in the front row. 
claire: very good, jerry. i wouldn t ve put you down as being so flexible. 
jerry: (smiling) well, you wouldn t have to. me down plenty. my wife puts 
beth: (to jerry) teacher s pet. the instructor, claire, walks behind jerry and places her hands on his back, leaning into him, sensually. 
claire: that s it, jerry. hold it there. doing great, babe. you re claire walks back to the front of the class. as her back is turned, beth shoves jerry and he falls over into a pile on the floor. 
jerry: (whispering) (to beth) hey! you were the one who wanted us to do more husband and wife stuff together. i m making the effort here.. 
beth: (whispering) i didn t think you and mrs. look-how-sensual-i-am would be flirting all lesson, babe . 
jerry: come on, beth. we re not flirting. she s just being nice. claire is now lying on her matt, right in front of jerry. she does the downward dog pose, deliberately squeezing her boobs together. she winks at jerry. beth glares at jerry. 
jerry: (nervous laugh) cut to 
[int. dudetator’s palace - day - a little later] 
morty and summer are sitting in big recliner chairs in the guest palace. morty has loads of hamburgers and jessica clones surrounding him. summer has buff surfer dudes surrounding her. a robot-butler stands ready for instruction. 
morty: (with mouthful of burger) oh, man. this this is really great, huh, summer? 
summer: i am never leaving this place. she squeezes the bicep of one of the surfers arms and giggles, taking selfies on her phone. rick enters in a dressing gown--he is clearly tired out. 
morty: oh, man, rick. thanks for bringing us here. this place is great. it s nice to, y know, not be doing crazy shit for once, huh? just, like, relaxing and stuff, y know? not saving the galaxy and stuff. 
rick: yeah, well, don t get too used to it, morty. if you stay here too long you ll turn into one of those annoying--. emperor dude enters, smoking a joint. 
dudetator:--yo, yo, yo. how are my little earthlings enjoying my dudetatorship paradise? he blows out smoke from the joint which forms the shape of a guy smoking a joint. 
summer: i. love. this. place, emperor. you so much for having--thank suddenly we hear screams and crashes from outside the palace. rick is stood in view of the window. he looks outside. 
rick: oh, man. that s a real (burp) cronenburg of a mess down there. 
morty: wh what s going on, rick? morty, summer, and emperor dude run over to the window. several giant, penis-shaped spaceships are landing on the planet. soldiers in penis-shaped armour exit the spaceships and begin blowing up the palaces, shooting white bullets at the civilians. people are running and screaming in terror. drag. oh, man. dudetator 
morty: wh-who the hell are those guys? 
rick: must be emperor dick of the dicktatorship regime. time to bail, guys. rick takes his portal gun out of his dressing down. 
dudetator: hey, man. that s not cool. like, some help up in here. we need, 
morty: yeah, rick. the dude and his people need us and stuff. we can t desert them in their, umm, time of need. 
summer: who the hell is emperor dick?. 
rick: that s not our problem, morty. 
morty: well, let s, y know, make it our problem. 
summer: umm, guys, i said who is emperor dick? 
rick: (ignoring summer) ok, ok, whatever. (to emperor dude) what s the plan (beat) dude? 
summer: who on earth is emperor dick?! 
rick: (burp) god damn it, summer. one, we re not on earth. two, who do you think? look out the freakin window. he s the tator of the freakin dick soldiers out there. tator is that a word? can i use that as a noun in that context? 
dudetator: yeah i think that s ok. grandpa rick! summer 
dudetator: little lady, it the most highly sworn enemy of me, the dudetator, and the dudes. the dicktator, he runs his planet like a real dick. i ve been expecting an invasion for some time to be honest. emperor dude takes out his electronic device thing and speaks into it. 
dudetator: dick-ship invasion in sector mobilise the dude army a-sap. (to rick) our dude-army won t stand much of a chance against a fully rocking dick army. they ll jack us off in no time, man. in hindsight we should have spent a little more time training. he sighs and walks over to the window--contemplative, somber music plays.. 
dudetator: if only i had paid more attention in fascist school. but no, i spent my time jacking off and smoking up... and masturbating. while, in the meantime, that dick out there was getting double eight-hundreds. he knew his fascism... still does. (sighs) i guess deep down i knew this day would come. (beat) man, i ve really mick jaggered this place up. 
summer: don t beat yourself up, mr. dudetator. 
morty: yeah, mr. emperor... dude. we can help you take down these dicks one and for all. 
rick: (sighs) politics. cut to 
[int. claire’s house - evening] 
jerry and claire are sat on the sofa in claire’s living room, drinking wine. 
claire: i m soooo glad you could come tonight, jerry. such a shame that beth couldn t make it. yeah. life. 
jerry: she got stuck saving a horse s you know how it is... 
claire: tell me about it. just one of those things. she takes a large gulp of wine. 
jerry: yeah... she s a real hero, though. her way around a horse. ha. 
claire: (not listening) don t we all. another very large gulp of wine. knows. you know, jerry, i ve noticed you re really in touch with your feminine side. 
jerry: well, thank you, claire. my wife happens to see my feminine side as being my bad side. 
claire: well she just doesn't get you, jerr'. you need someone to nurture your emotions, your feelings. she shifts closer to him on the sofa, a little of her wine sloshes out onto her shirt. she giggles, flirtatiously, then takes another sip. 
jerry: (uncomfortable) haha. yeah, i guess. i dunno, maybe yoga wasn t the best idea for us. it seems to have made her, i dunno, jealous. 
claire: it s hurts me that you-you feel that way. that she has made you feel that way. you're so, so good at yoga, jerr --my top student in fact--but clearly beth is ashamed of her body and her lack of flexibility. that much is clear. there is an aggressive knock at the front door. ignores it and swigs her wine. claire but you, jerry. you don t deserve her. you there is another knock, much louder this time. 
darius  (o. s) : open the damn door, claire! hmm. 
claire: (nervous laugh) haha. i m sure that s nothing. she knows exactly who it is. 
jerry: doesn t sound like nothing. whoever that is, he sounds pretty riled up.. 
claire: noooo. probably one of those girl scouts selling their cookies. look at my figure though; obviously can t partake. suddenly the front door is smashed down and a large, black, muscly guy, darius, enters. claire! calls?! 
darius: why the hell won t you return my claire stands up, clearly drunk, her wine spills. 
claire: get ouuuut, darius! (she points at door) i don t need you anymore. i have jerry. jerry and i were having a nice conversation until you barged in here... all sweaty and muscly. 
darius: who the hell is jerry?! 
jerry: hello, there. darius was it? claire s yoga student, jerry. i m jerry holds out his hand to shake, but darius slaps it out of the way. 
darius: i ve been looking for you everywhere! you weren t at the gym! 
claire: (indignant) hmm. i guess i wasn t. you check? where else did 
darius: what am i, sherlock freakin holmes?! why you hanging out with this pussy white boy?! 
claire: he s not a pussy! he s kind, funny, gentle, and my best yoga student... and white. 
darius: sounds like the definition of a freakin pussy to me! jerry edges towards the door. to be out of this house. he wants nothing more than. 
jerry: i should i should probably go... no, jerry. leaving. 
claire: it s fine. darius was just 
darius: like hell i was, bitch! claire grabs jerry and starts making out with him. 
claire: (to darius) (slurring words) how do you like that, huh? jerry tries to pull away. oh, hell no! 
darius: darius grabs jerry and flings him across the room. 
jerry: owwww! camera follows jerry as he crawls along the floor to escape through the front door. darius and claire continue arguing. 
darius  (o. s) : i don t want you hanging around with no silly little white guys! 
claire  (o. s) : i m a grown woman, darius! out with whoever i please! i can hang 
darius: it s whom-ever, bitch! oh, darius. my grammar. 
claire: i love it when you correct 
darius: i love it when we argue. fired up! gets me all 
claire: take me here, dary! we hear claire and darius making out off screen. jerry, having crawled to the front door, sets off running down the street.. 
claire  (o. s) : see you next week, jerry! darius erotic grunts are audible. 
[ext. dudetatorship planet - day - a little later] 
rick, morty, summer, and emperor dude are running down the street. rick and dude fire lasers at the dicktator’s penis shaped soldiers. 
dudetator: hurry! this way! over by the river. if we can make it to my dude-ship, i know somewhere we can go to get help. 
morty: geez, rick. all these soldiers are shaped like, y know, junk. 
summer: oh my god. this is so gross and weird. why did we even come here? the penis shaped soldiers are gaining on them. dude s dude-army has almost entirely depleted. emperor 
rick: listen, morty. make yourself useful and (burp) shoot some of these guys for me will you? rick hands a laser gun to morty. morty shoots a soldier, but another one grabs him from behind. rick and emperor dude wrestle the soldier off of morty. while rick is distracted, several dick-soldiers run up and grab summer and drag her away. summer!! morty 
summer: ahhh help me, grandpa rick!! 
dudetator: draag. oh, crap. rick 
morty: oh, man, rick! we gotta go after her! 
dudetator: we gotta press on, dudes. i know a planet we can get some back up and take these cocksuckers down.. 
rick: they re not cocksuckers though are they? as in, they don't suck themselves. as they are literally cocks. 
dudetator: hmm. i guess you're right. just a figure of speech anyway, man. 
morty: oh man, rick! w-we have to go help summer. this isn't really the time for phallic debates! 
rick: listen, morty. these guys are a whole army. we don t stand much chance of rescuing summer without some reinforcements. reinforskinments? nah--clutching at straws. 
dudetator: you're grand-dude makes a good point, little man. if we can get to my ex-ladies planet, she can sort us out some troops, and such. your ex-lady? 
rick: oh, man. not her. another platoon of soldiers rounds the corner firing at the trio. come on, bros. we gotta hightail it. the dudetator presses a button on his electronic device and a giant surfboard rounds the corner. it knocks down the soldiers. surfs up! dudetator
morty: geez, mr. dudetator. why didn't you, y know, mention that you had this giant surfboard getaway vehicle earlier on? like we-we could have really used it back there. 
dudetator: good question little man. i only just remembered, actually--this stuff messes with your brain. dudetator throws his joint away and shakes his head. octopus legs swing side to side. his. rick, morty, and the dudetator zoom off on the big surfboard, knocking down soldiers in their path. they come to a river where there is a giant pair of sunglasses. come on! 
dudetator: into the dude-ship! 
rick: this is what you re driving these days? the three of them hop off the surfboard and board the ship that is shaped like a giant pair of sunglasses. 
[int. dudeship - continuous] 
dudetator stands at the control panel. damn, what s her address, man? i gotta punch it into the gps. morty stares at the scene of carnage out of one of the sunglasses lenses (the window of the ship). rick stands at the back door, shooting soldiers who are hastily approaching the ship. 
rick: can we hurry this up a little?! 
dudetator: um, how do you spell god damn it. 
rick: get out of the way. rick runs over to the ship s control panel, shoving the dudetator to one side, he grabs the steering wheel and pilots the ship off of dudetatorship s planet. 
morty: geez, rick. i really hope summer is okay. it s pretty messy down there. 
[int. dudetatorship’s throne - meanwhile] 
dicktator is top human and bottom half octopus -- the same species as the dudetator. he is wearing emperor style clothes, long red cape, crown covering his head, etc.. he sits at the dudetator’s throne, surrounded by soldiers and laughing evilly. scary music, etc. camera pans round to show summer locked up in a glass box in the shape of a penis. two soldiers with guns stand on either side of her. help! 
summer: let me out! 
dicktator: (evil voice) muahaha. your puny, democracy riddled brains are no match for a full blown--no pun intended-- (beat) dicktatorship! muahaha 
soldier 1: sir, i ve finished running your bath. 
dicktator: (jolly voice) wonderful. did you use my bubblies? 
soldier 1: i did use your bubblies, yes, sir. 
dicktator: good, good. (beat) candles? you use any candles? did did 
soldier 1: yes, sir. i have an array of candles lit ready for you. well, good. 
dicktator: i ll come now then, shall i?

beth: goodbye, jerry. she walks out the front door. couch. jerry slumps into the. 
[ext. ladytatorship’s planet - day] 
the dudetator’s sunglasses ship crash lands on the surface of a planet. the ground is pink, there are flowers everywhere, there are palaces, similar to the previous planet, but they are pink. all the civilians are female. 
rick: (shudders) i hate this place. 
dudetator: i feel you, bro. it s a bit of a drag but, y know, we need to get some help and such. 
morty: (staring at the attractive women walking by) what is this place? 
rick: it s the ladytatorship s planet. run by the ladytator. possibly the most dominating dictatorship of the whole galaxy. 
morty: um. it doesn't really look that dominating, rick. 
dudetator: believe me, little marty -morty. morty 
dudetator: my ex-wife can be a real stone cold bitch. a spaceship shaped like a giant flower lands right in front of them. the door opens and the ladytator--tall attractive, same kind of octopus human breed as dude and dick--steps out in front of rick, morty and dudetator. 
ladytator: hello, rick. phil. how lovely to see you both. who is this little squirt you have with you? she tussles morty s hair. her beauty. he gazes at her, infatuated by. 
rick: (unenthused) hello, abigail. this is my grandson, morty. 
dudetator: abigail. sorry i haven't called. been real hectic down it s 
ladytator: save it, phil. walk with me, boys. the four of them walk along the high street. we pass various shops with signs that read men slaves for sale , men bought and sold , etc. they enter a giant pink palace and there is a throne in the middle of a line of couches (laid out loose women style). men in dog collars and chains bring women food and massage their feet. 
[int. palace - continuous] 
morty: (to rick) oh, man. rick. are men, like, slaves on this planet or something? 
ladytator: i ll field this one, rick. (to morty) little, morty. many, many years ago, my kingdom and your friend dudetator s kingdom co-existed in peace and harmony. we lived joyous lives in a society where men and women all got along. unfortunately, i found out the hard way that men are pigs. she shoots a mean look at the dudetator uh-huh. morty 
ladytator: i m sure that phil would have another side to the whole argument. anyway there was a great war and, to cut a long story short we split our kingdoms in two. we formed two separate dictatorships--one for men and one for women. phil, the great dudetator, chose surfing, smoking weed and playing guitar over working and building a strong army. an army which he. and i both knew, we would someday need. i, however, have an immensely strong army. one that i have worked hard to train and maintain. this, i imagine, is the reason you three have come here today. 
rick: yup. pretty much. dudetator 
morty: we ve really, umm, run into some trouble, mrs. ladytator. 
ladytator: i see. well phil and i have a mutual agreement whereby should the evil third dictatorship regime mobilise its army and invade either of us, we would help one another out. 
morty: oh man. and this evil third regime is the-the-the guys shaped like penises? duh. 
rick: keep up, morty. 
dudetator: yes, marty. morty. morty 
dudetator: my evil twin brother was jealous of mine and abigail s joint kingdom. he knew he was no match for us when we were together. then, when we had the great domestic violence war of 4034 and ladytator and i separated, dicktator saw his chance to build an army greater than our individual armies could ever match. hence, despite our differences, abigail and i made this pact, so that, if the dicktator were ever to invade either of us, we could defeat him. but, i didn't really hold up my side of the bargain, i knew this day would come, and i procrastinated, like all good dudes do. and now.... (turning to ladytator) i m begging for your help, abigail. we need your army to restore peace to the galaxy. no. what?! ladytatorrick, morty and dudetator 
ladytator: why should i sacrifice thousands of my beautiful women army--waste them--sacrifice them--just to restore a men s club of marijuana and rock music? 
rick: that s a good point. 
morty: that-that s not a good point, rick. oh, man, rick. i-i mean summer s still held prisoner by the dicks, y know? 
ladytator: who is this summer? 
morty: my sister. 
rick: my granddaughter. 
ladytator: well, why the hell didn't you say so? if a fellow female is imprisoned, then my army shall be mobilised. she takes out a small electronic device and speaks into it. 
ladytator: kerry, code pink. sfx triumphant, brass musical sting.

[ext. golf course - day - day 2] 
beth is lining up a shot on the golf course. behind her, hands on her shoulders. fred stands 
fred: that s right, square your shoulders 
beth: yeah, thanks, fred. i know how to golf though. i had to teach jerry in a freezer one time when millions of mr meseeks... you know what? that s not important right now. i m just enjoying being out of the house and playing a fun game of golf. 
fred: well, i m enjoying it too, beth. spending time with you. i love he pats her butt, playfully. fred! 
beth: don t do that. 
fred: s sorry, beth. i m only playing. he continues to stand too close behind her while she lines up her shot. 
beth: do you mind just stepping a little ways back, please? sorry. 
fred: say no more. he holds up his hands and shuffles only a single step back. beth continues to line up her shot. 
beth: here goes... 
fred: you wanna have your legs like he leans down and strokes her legs. 
beth: right! that s it, fred. if i had known you only wanted to play golf with me so you could touch me up, i never would have bothered.. 
fred: but you re just so beautiful-- 
beth: save it, fred. i m going home to my husband. at least he doesn't have the balls to touch me unless i say so. she throws her club down, gets in the golf cart and drives off. fred starts to run after her. 
fred: beth! i m sorry. please come back. it-its a real long walk back to the club house. a coyote howls in the distance. 
[ext. ladytatorship planet - a little later] 
rick, morty, and dudetator stand outside the sunglasses dudeship. it looks rather busted, emitting smoke. in the background, hundreds of female soldiers, dressed in pink metal armour, carrying guns, run past in a line and enter large, blimp-like war ships. 
morty: oh, man, rick. the dudeship looks pretty busted up. 
dudetator: yeah, man. that s the price you pay for having a ship in the shape of a pair of sunglasses--it really is incredibly fragile. worth it though, right?! 
rick: not to worry, guys. i got this one. rick takes out his portal gun and blasts it in front of them. the green, swirling portal appears. 
morty: w-wait, rick. if all this time you ve had, y know, your portal gun, then, w-why didn't we use it back on the dick planet dude planet-dudetator 
morty: to escape and stuff? maybe summer wouldn't have got, y know, got taken. 
rick: huh. you know what, morty, i was so freakin out of it after (burp) banging those two robot-girls, that it totally slipped my mind. 
morty: geez, rick. that s really stupid. y-your a real piece of work sometimes, y know? 
rick: hey! lay off, morty. i remembered that i have it now. so, y know, no big deal, right? we ll portal into the dick infested planet, rescue summer and then. ignore politics for rest of our lives, like every normal american. the three of them run into the portal. 
[ext. lip-tatorship planet - day] 
rick, morty, and dudetator portal onto a planet where everyone has a pair of lips for a face. 
rick: whoops. looks like i took us to lip-tatorship by accident. haha. about that, huh, morty? how camera pans round to show several giant pairs of lips trying to eat morty. he is struggling to get away. 
morty: oh, geez, rick! help! 
rick: all right, all right. rick shoots the lips and they release morty. rick then fires his portal gun again, the three of them step through the portal. 
[ext. glue-tatorship planet - continuous] 
rick, morty, and dudetator portal onto a planet where the floor is made of glue. they lift up their feet one by one, a trail of sticky glue is revealed underfoot. horses gallop in the distance. a giant slug approaches them. 
rick: this must be glue-tatorship. nearly there. we re 
morty: hurry up, rick! that giant slug is getting p pretty close! relax, morty. 
rick: rick shoots his portal gun and they step through once again. 
[ext. potatorship planet - continuous] 
rick, morty, and dudetator arrive on planet potatorship, or, as it is pronounced, ’potato chip’.. potato chips walk around eating bags of people. (this is a homage to the pizza universe in the close rick-counters of the rick kind.) 
rick: i liked the pizza one better. he fires the portal gun once again and they step through to... 
[ext. dudetatorship planet - day] 
finally back on dudetator’s planet, the dick emperor has begun erecting phallic shaped palaces in the place of the demolished ones. he has enslaved the remaining dude citizens and scenes of carnage are everywhere. rick, morty, and dudetator arrive. oh, drag. crib? oooh. 
dudetator: what have they done to my 
rick: this is a real sausage fest. 
morty: rick, let s go and find summer! the ladytator s giant blimp ships start to land on the planet. female soldiers start running out and fighting with dicktator s soldiers. ladytator s army weapons include vagina throwing stars, tampon torpedoes, stiletto knives, etc. 
dudetator: you dudes go on. i m gunna stand and fight. after all ladytator and i have been through, it s the least i can 
rick: yeah whatever. see ya later, phil. (to morty) let s go, morty! rick chucks morty a laser gun and the two of them run through the carnage, blasting the dick soldiers with lasers. slow motion shot; gangster rap music plays. 
rick: let s head to the main palace. morty! come on,. morty is struggling to fend off a group of dick-soldiers. rick blasts them all with his gun and the two run off down the street toward the palace. 
[int. main palace corridor - a little later] 
(rick and morty creep down the corridors of the main palace. they duck into a corner as two soldiers walk by. one of the soldiers knocks his head on the ceiling (homage to star wars stormtrooper))
rick: (whispering) come on, morty. this way. they sneak down the corridor and pass the bathroom. emperor dick is sat in a bubble bath, surrounded by candles. lounge-jazz music plays. he drives a penis-shaped rubber duck around the bath. 
emperor dick: another successful invasion, huh, rubber dicky? what the ? oh, man. rick 
morty: he is one weird dude. emperor dick doesn t notice them and they continue along the corridor. two soldiers turn the corner and lift their weapons. morty takes both of them out. 
rick: nice work, morty. those two dicks. you really nailed 
morty: th-thanks, rick. i really wish you wouldn't have put it like that though. 
[int. main palace room - continuous] 
they come to the main room of the palace where summer is still trapped inside the phallic shaped glass box. four soldiers have their backs to rick and morty.. 
summer: (noticing them) grandpa rick! morty! rick puts his finger up to his mouth, indicating her to be quiet. the soldiers do not hear her. rick shoots three of the soldiers while morty climbs on one of their backs, wrapping his arms around the soldiers throat, trying to strangle him. the soldier grabs morty and throws him to the ground, taking out his gun. rick quickly and effortlessly shoots the soldier. 
rick: morty, what the hell are you doing? didn t you just shoot him? why 
morty: sometimes th the easiest ways aren't always the best, y know, rick. i wanted to try something new. 
rick: well in this case the easiest way was in fact the best. 
morty: well, in this case, yes. rick. for example--umm. here! guys?! but not always 
summer: get me the hell out of rick shoots the glass with his laser gun and it shatters. glass rains down onto summer. she is unharmed, however. (beat) grandpa, rick! you could have killed me. 
rick: yeah, whatever. come on. out of here. we re getting 
morty: geez, rick. shouldn't we, y know, help them defeat this dick army? fiiine. rick. 
[ext. dudetatorship battleground - continuous] 
the three of them run back outside the palace and down to where the fighting is taking place. most of the erect phallic shaped palaces have gone flaccid, most of the dick-soldiers imprisoned or killed, and the remaining ones are being swiftly taken out by ladytator and dudetator’s combined army. ladytator and dudetator have teamed up and are fighting back to back against the few remaining dick-soldiers. 
rick: doesn t really look like they need out help, huh, morty? hmm. 
morty: i guess not, rick. 
summer: well, can we go home then, please? i ve been trapped inside a glass penis for several hours and would really like to go home and forget about this not. so. 
emperor dick  (o. s) : fast. rick, morty, and summer swerve round to see emperor dick standing behind them, holding a gun. he is fresh from the tub and wearing a bath robe with his initials on. 
rick: give it up, emperor! it s over. 
morty: y yeah, emperor dick. like, quit while you still have your dignity, y know. 
emperor dick: i must fight till the very end. 
rick: this is the very end. there s like two minutes left of the show and we still need to wrap up that stuff with jerry and beth. fine. 
emperor dick: kill meeee. finish me off. 
summer: don t be that way, emperor. you still have like so much going for you. just quit with the invading other planets stuff.. 
rick: (to morty) sounds like someone contracted a little stockholm syndrome, ey, morty? 
morty: geez, rick. i do feel like i m coming down with something. 
emperor dick: he means your sister, boy. oh. 
morty: oh, yeah, i know. 
emperor dick: (light hearted voice) so where were we? oh yes... (dramatic) kiiiill meeee! fine. 
rick: rick shoots him and he explodes. dude and ladytator, having finished fighting, walk over to rick, morty, and summer. 
ladytator: rick, morty, and summer, thank you all for your immense help. peace has been restored to the galaxy. 
morty: are you guys gunna, like, hook up again? re-kindle th the flame and stuff? 
ladytator: well, (smiling at dudetator) we re gunna go on a few dates and see where it leads. i m not promising that we will combine our resources and form one super powered dominating he-she-tatorship kingdom. 
dude:... but who knows? lady and dude smile at one another. 
rick: (to lady and dude) well, we better be getting back. see you guys next time there s an election and these two idiots start asking me stupid questions again.. 
morty: don t worry, rick. i m going to do what i should have done a long time ago. 
rick: ignore politics until it s too late? exactly. 
morty: rick shoots the portal gun and rick, morty, and summer step through it. 
[int. morty’s house - living room - evening] 
beth is on the sofa, looking miserable. oh, hi. jerry enters.jerry 
beth: hi. 
jerry: how was golf? 
beth: fine. are you sure? yes. jerry 
beth: how was your day? 
jerry: it was ok. at least i didn't get beat up by a huge black guy today. not yet anyway. 
beth: i m sorry i was such a bitch 
jerry: i m sorry i was such a bitch. 
beth: can we just agree to never take part in any extra curricular activities ever again? 
jerry: sounds good to me, sweetheart.. they hug just as rick, morty, and summer step through the portal into the living room. oh good. plot? 
rick: you guys sorted out your sub- 
jerry: yes, indeed we did. get up to today? what did you guys 
morty: y know, j just learning about politics. they all laugh cheesily. camera fades into a circle--looney tunes style--as they do so. 
(rick, looking a bit more well adjusted than his usual drunk self, is eating lunch with morty and summer.)
(summer, wearing her usual pink tank top, is unimpressed with the lunch rick prepared; leftovers from medieval times) 
summer: it s not as good as yesterday at the arena. 
rick: don t blame me. i m not the one who decided to sell a wastel made by a college dropout with no tongue. 
morty: wastel? what s that? 
rick: you wouldn t know, wouldn t you, morty? not with this trash bread as a reference. 
morty: it tasted fine in medieval times. 
rick: nothing is fine in medieval times, morty. they have more in common with kalandixian cockfighting than a medieval kingdom. 
summer: what do you even know about medieval times? i thought you were more of a sci-fi guy than a fantasy guy. 
rick: i dabbled in the fantastic arts. i spent 3 months in a medieval fantasy kingdom once. i told them i m a wizard. i was hot shit. i lived with the king and shit. 
summer   morty  (simultaneously) : and? cool! rick you re underestimating my experiences? 
summer: you have the same boastful face my gf makes when she tells me about real mexican food when we re at taco bell. 
rick: a bit freudian, isn t it, summer? also, who takes their girlfriend to taco bell? 
morty: haha, yeah. 
summer   rick  (simultaneously) : shut up, morty. 
summer: i m just saying that authenticity isn t all it s cracked up to be. 
rick: i ll prove it. then. we ll visit hussielot right now. rick opens a portal without looking, the portal slices off a corner of the table. morty and summer are taken aback. 
morty: woah, right now? 
rick: blame your sister, morty. 
morty: since when do you care what summer thinks? 
summer: yeah, since when do you care what i think? 
morty: besides, we re eating lunch. rick we ll finish it in the royal dining room. rick steps in to the portal. morty and summer trade befuddled stares and follow him inside. the portal closes. 
[ext. forest outside of hussielot. noon.] 
rick, morty and summer walk through the heavily wooded area. tiny alien-looking animals run away as they step. rick pulls out a laser machete and cuts their way through. 
rick: huh, this place was a slum last time i ve been here. 
morty: and when was that? 
rick: 30-31 years? i was on a lot of frog-extract back then. 
summer: figures. maybe they reforested since then. 
rick: the king of hussielot isn t into environmentalism and helpful shit, summer. he was a brutal man. 
morty: was? 
rick: he was like 25 back then, he d probably be dead by now. hussielot is a... it s a real shithole, morty. rick cuts through the last batch of vines and reveals the kingdom beyond. it is a technological paradise, with tall buildings full of hanging forests. high-tech ships and laser walkways extend through the sky. a giant metallic ring hangs above the city, with ships coming and going in droves through a portal in its center. summer if this place is a genuine medieval shithole than medieval times is an 11yo s fanfiction. rick grumbles. 
[ext. hussielot main street. afternoon.] 
rick, morty and summer are walking through the stone paved streets of hussielot. the people in the marketplace are clean and healthy looking, and aliens walk among them. 
rick: looks like hussielot had quite the renaissance since i ve been here. 
morty: maybe you inspired them to become better than they used to be, rick. 
summer: or maybe they just needed some time away from you. 
rick: shut up, summer. i m like a celebrity here. a few guards approach. they re wearing high-tech looking medieval armor and carrying laser swords. 
guard: halt. you re a stranger in this city. 
rick: i m no stranger, bucko. i m fucking scientos. the guards do not react. 
summer: pff... scientos? 
morty: bucko ? rick you know, the legendary wizard? i m friends with the king. the guards whisper among themselves. they seem a bit worried. 
guard: come with us, wizard. the king would like to see you. 
rick: told you. 
[int. hussielot royal palace. throne room. afternoon.] 
rick, summer and morty, accompanied by the guards, walk through the royal palace. paintings are hanging off the walls alongside holographic images depicting various events from the history of hussielot. the events include their first encounter with aliens, and how the aliens helped build their new improved society. one of the paintings depicts a young rick in a wizard outfit standing over a slain red dragon with testicle-like growths on its chin. the king walks in surrounded by guards. he is wearing a techno head brace and sports a healthy head of red hair and beard. his granddaughter, princess dowry, walks besides him. she is wearing a cute sci-fi-fantasy fusion dress. morty is smitten with the princess. 
king: scientos! my old friend! 
rick: hello, your majesty. i actually go by rick these days. and these two are my uncouth grandkids morty and summer. they didn t believe i used to be in your majesty s royal court. king scientos here was the wisest of my advisors. his inventions brought us prosperity and allowed us to vanquish the dragon race once and for all. 
summer: genocide, huh? your fantasy life had the same problematic trappings as your sci-fi one. 
king: rick left us with the bounty of his inventions. it was then that we realized he was not magical but rather a man of natural philosophy. and thanks to his improvised space beacon we encountered our alien allies who helped us build our new modern society. 
rick: yeah... rick looks around the advanced surroundings. 
rick: you re welcome for that. say, you wouldn t be having lunch soon? i told my grandkids they ll get to try authentic hussielotian cuisine. 
king: for you, my friend. we ll be holding a feast! 
[int. hussielot royal palace. dining room. evening.] 
the king is sitting at the top of a long table. rick is sitting to his right and his granddaughter to his left. summer sits next to rick and morty sits next to the princess. 
princess dowry: my grandpa told me a lot about your grandpa. morty yeah, he s been... he s been doing some wild stuff in his years. 
princess dowry: so i ve heard. 
morty: i ve been on a lot of adventures with him, actually. i could probably tell you a lot more stories than your grandpa did. the princess smiles a cute royal smile at morty. morty blushes. 
princess dowry: i m sure i will love hearing them. 
morty: y-you think so? 
princess dowry: if grandfather wills it. 
morty: mr. mr. your majesty. can i spend some time with dowry? 
king: if scient-i mean rick confers. rick is prodding at his synthetic-looking alien food. 
rick: yeah, sure. whatever. 
king: is something the matter, old friend? is the food our authenticators produce not authentic enough for you? the king chuckles. rick doesn t seem pleased. summer is sporting a cat-like grin. summer yeah, grandpa rick. is it not what you expected? 
rick: it s just things used to be more... organic back in our days. 
king: ah, yes. when i was a younger man. 
rick: exactly. 
king: a foolish man. obsessed with conquest. easily taken in by the most obvious of ploys. of magic and mystery. 
rick: i mean, maybe. but that s what made this place so um... charming. 
king: so easy to exploit. to leave defenseless. the king s face grows serious. 
king: when you left, my old friend. i swore to keep this kingdom safe, forever. the king smiles again. 
king: and i have. 
summer: i think what you did with this place is amazing, your majesty. rick gets up. rick well, this slog is delicious and certainly not something we could have eaten in any half decent starhop stop in the milky way. 
summer: grandpa rick. don t be rude! 
king: don t be too harsh on your grandpa, child of the season. he is just nostalgic for the olden days. the king turns to rick. 
king: you know. we haven t given up on all of our old institutions. 
rick: the pit of champions? 
king: you and i think alike, you and your family in the castle tonight. travel to the my old friend. shall sleep tomorrow we ll pit. 
[int. hussielot royal palace. bedroom. night.] 
summer is preparing her bed, ready to go to sleep. rick fidgets with his portal gun. morty seems anxious to leave. 
summer: you know, grandpa rick. i didn t think you could be good for anywhere. i always thought you just left every place in shambles. rickshambles would be an improvement to this place, trust me. now they re just like every other colony in the universe. 
morty: i did notice that almost every society we visited was basically the same. 
summer: the one time you leave a world better than you found it, and you think it s wrong? 
rick: i m not responsible for this cultural genocide. 
summer: no, just the dragon race s genocide. 
rick: you ll get your chance to see dragons in a second... and... there. rick shoots his portal gun at the balcony, opening a portal. 
morty: what is it? rick takes morty and summer in his arms and pushes all three of their heads through the portal. the land they see below them is a savage and dirty medieval city, very unlike the technological utopia they re currently in. 
rick: the real hussielot. the genuine article. 
summer: what, is the golden gate bridge blue in this version or something? rickclose. this version never got introduced to modern technology and remained true to themselves. morty takes his head out of the portal. rick and summer do so as well. 
morty: actually, i promised the princess i ll meet her later. 
rick: summer? 
summer: whatever, i don t need to mack on a royal doormat. i ll come with you. 
rick: so we re off. rick jumps into the portal. summer turns towards morty. 
summer: be careful not to spoil her for marriage, virgin. 
morty: gross. summer jumps into the portal. 
[int. alternate hussielot. royal palace hallway.​ ​ night.] 
rick and summer are sneaking through the halls, trying to avoid detection by guards wearing a much more simplistic version of the same outfit worn by the guards in the other hussielot. 
summer: why are we sneaking around? we re supposed to be guests here. 
rick: not here. here we really are strangers. summerso? just introduce yourself to the king as a wizard again like you did last time. they ll be extra impressed this time since you re so old. 
rick: great jab, but it s not what i m aiming to do. 
summer: which is? 
rick: getting thrown in the pit of champions. rick kicks in a door. summer covers her face. 
summer: oh god! inside the room, the queen, an older looking and much less healthy version of dowry, is covering her naked body with her bed covers. 
queen: guards! 
[int. alternate hussielot dungeon. early morning.] 
rick and summer are sitting in a dungeon with a bunch of other brutes and prisoners. summer is crouching in the corner in plain medieval clothes. 
summer: i hate you. rick is fiddling with an iron sword, moving it from hand to hand and judging its weight. 
rick: don t worry. it s gonna be fun. we ll do some killing and after that we ll storm the castle and take back my portal gun. and if not, i programmed it to find us. summerwe re not going to survive that long! you re not a swordsman! i m not a swords... girl. 
rick: no, you re a whiny swords baby. but by the time we re done, you ll grow up to be a sword woman. 
summer: i don t wanna grow up in hussielot! 
random prisoner: yeah! me neither! i wanna grow up in a fair and just society! a society that can develop plenty and bring it to her people! a society that tolerates us all from the meek to the mighty! 
rick: great, you started a cultural revolution, summer. now i m gonna have to kill him first. 
[int. hussielot royal palace. princess dowry’s room. night.] 
morty rings an electronic doorbell 
princess dowry: come in, morty. morty opens the door and enters. he is surprised to see the princess crying. 
morty: oh, ooh boy... is it a bad time? i was hoping i could tell you some some... rick and morty stories. 
princess dowry: it s okay, morty. i know why you re here. you got your patriarch s blessing. you got my patriarch s blessing. morty patriarch? i don t think rick is much of a family leader. heck, my mom is more of a patriarch than him. 
princess dowry: y-your mother? the princess sniffles. 
morty: yeah, she calls the shots around my house not even my dad argues with her. 
princess dowry: is that really how life is like in the house of scientos? if that s the case, then maybe... the princess resumes crying. 
princess dowry: maybe after i give birth to your children it won t be that bad. 
morty: woah there! what are you talking about?! 
princess dowry: just do your vile deed and get it over with, morty. 
morty: what did you think i came here for, dowry? 
princess dowry: earlier at dinner. you claimed me as your wife. and now you ve come to use your property and consummate our union. 
morty: w-what! no! i mean, i was kinda hoping that... but like, not like this. i didn t come to claim anybody! princess dowrydid you not have coital intentions toward me at the dinner table? 
morty: i mean, i did. but i was hoping to get to know you first so... y know... so you could return those feelings. or not. 
princess dowry: i didn t know refusing even was an option. 
morty: oh boy... 
[ext. alternate hussielot. pit of champions. morning.] 
the pit is packed to the brim with hungry and sick looking peasants. the queen is sitting on a chair overseeing the arena, she is breastfeeding a baby while two slightly older children sit by her side. four knights exit the four corners of the arena, in four different colors. they’re riding on horseback and are traveling in circles. a platform rises in the middle of the arena. the prisoners are huddled together on it, including rick and summer. rick and summer are dolled up in some basic chainmail armor, each pick up a sword. summer is shaking, but rick seems confident. he inserts a usb-drive into the pommel of his sword, reprogramming it, and allowing him to kick ass. he slices and dices the other prisoners while the knights continue to circle them. summer in the meantime tries to maintain a distance, only occasionally hurting or blocking anybody, until she accidentally stabs the prisoner that was preaching revolution earlier in the dungeon. in the end,only summer and rick remain. rick turns to her. summer looks at the queen. 
summer: are you not entertained?! rick wrong era, summer. the queen seems bored, she d fiddling around with rick s portal gun while her children play with the sci-fi machete. 
royal announcer: the prisoners must leave one champion to try and claim his place among the four horsemen. 
rick: you heard the woman, summer. 
summer: grandpa! i m not fighting you. 
rick: you wanted a genuine medieval experience, well here it is. 
summer: no, i didn t. you wanted a genuine medieval experience. i was fine with acting. summer inserts a similar usb-drive into her sword and swings at rick. he is surprised by her tenacity. 
summer: that s all you seem to care about. you want us to live in reality so much. summer swings at rick again, he blocks her. 
rick: shut up, summer. summer s tenacity takes the upper hand on rick. the queen seems to be quite entertained. 
summer: but this isn t reality. this isn t my authentic life. it s a fantasy scenario you created. and after this match is over, we re gonna go back home and forget this ever happened, while these people will live with the consequences of our vacation and their shitty lives! summer defeats rick. as he is lying on the ground, the four knights surround them. summer raises the sword above his neck. 
summer: authentic enough for you? a roar is heard from up in the sky. everybody looks up. 
rick: oh yeah, i forgot. dragons are still alive in this universe. 
[int. hussielot royal palace. outside situation room. night] 
princess dowry and morty are standing outside of the room. princess dowry is walking back and forth while morty approaches. 
morty: don t worry, princess. i m sure your grandpa will clear all of this up. 
princess dowry: i hope so, too. morty comes to knock on the door, but before his hand lands, the door opens, and the king is standing there. 
king: is there a problem, grandchild of scientos? 
morty: hello, your majesty. we were actually here to ask you a question. can we come in? morty looks inside the room. the king s advisors are inside, and they quickly turn off their holograms and documents. kingbut of course. morty, the princess and the king enter the room. 
morty: so previously, during dinner. when i asked you if i could spend some time with princess dowry, and you said yes. you didn t mean that in the marriage blessing way, right? 
king: of course not, young one. i would never give my granddaughter in marriage to somebody like you... 
morty: well, there s no need to insult me... 
princess dowry: phew... 
morty: oh man... 
king:... who would be dead the next morning. the king reactivates the holograms, showing the details for the execution of rick, morty, and summer in the pit of champions. 
[ext. alternate hussielot. pit of champions. morning.] 
the four knights are evacuating the people and the queen and her children from the premises as the roars of the dragon get closer. rickhuh, i guess the life of a royal hussielot knight are less exciting than in legend. 
summer: grandpa, what are we gonna do? rick checks a holographic watch inside his wrist. the hologram shows a timer counting back 5 seconds or so. 
rick: relax, i taught you my lesson, it s time to go home. the countdown reaches 0. rick s portal gun flies off of the queen s hands and he catches it in a cool action pose before catching the laser machete in a similar manner. 
summer: no, grandpa! we re not abandoning these people! summer grabs the laser machete off of rick. she puts on the black knight armor that was prepared for the winner in the pit. she struggles with putting it on. 
summer: fasten my armor, please. rick sighs and helps her out. the dragon flies down onto the arena. it looks a lot like the dragon in the painting of rick in the other hussielot, except blue instead of red. summer puts on her helmet and rides to battle. the scene turns into the style of an oil painting before fading to black. 
[ext. hussielot pit of champions. noon.] 
the technologically advanced hussielot’s pit of champions is a lot like the primitive one, except bigger and with aliens and holograms and other advanced technologies. but other than that, it’s exactly the same, with the four knights and the rising platform with prisoners on it.the king rises and speaks into a floating megaphone. princess dowry is standing next to him, looking worried. 
king: today we have a special guest here in the pit of champions. morty, grandchild of scientos! the crowd boos. the king begins detailing the story of why morty is being judged. as he speaks, holograms depicting the events show up in the stadium. morty cringes every time he sees something terrible his grandpa was responsible for. 
king: 30 years ago, our kingdom was left in chaos. the dragons were gone, and with them absent the rat population grew. and so did the snake population as they fed on the rats. 
king: the wizard scientos abandoned us, and left his highly corrosive and dangerous lab behind. 
king: which then exploded and left our people in an even more dire situation as radiated mutants roamed our streets, eating the healthy citizens of hussielot. 
king: it was because of him that i was forced to concede my kingdom to the galactic federation which has enslaved us and eroded our culture. 
king: and so now, with this last of our proud institutions. we shall punish the grandchild of the wizard! the crowd cheers. princess dowry stands up and waves towards morty. princess dowrygrandfather, stop! i m in love with him! 
morty: you re not in love with me. you re just convinced you re into me because i m the first person who treated you with respect and you re grateful i didn t rape you. 
princess dowry: oh yeah, that must be it. princess dowry seems much happier now. 
princess dowry: still, i hope you don t die! 
morty  (sighing) : thank you, princess. 
king: let the battle of champions begin! just as the battle is about to begin and morty is about to get wasted by a bunch of alien prisoners, a green portal opens. summer exits the portal and slices the alien about to kill morty with the laser machete. 
king   princess dowry: the black knight?! 
morty: summer? 
summer: did i hit her? summer takes off her helmet and looks at the alien head impaled on her sword. 
summer: dang, you can t see anything in this thing. i was hoping to hit the royal slut. princess dowry hey! rick exits the portal, drinking. 
rick: are we done here? what is here? 
morty: they were about to kill me because of what you did 30 years ago. 
summer: wow. you really are the worst, grandpa rick. 
rick: yeah, i figured. 
morty: you left them at the mercy of mutants and the galactic federation. the king interjects 
king: what is going on here?! continue the trial now that they re all here! 
rick: listen, kingy. your majesty. i realized today that i tend to be kind of a hypocrite sometimes. 
summer: yes, so let us make it up to you! 
rick: what? summer! i was just gonna apologize. 
king: making up to us, how? summer we ll liberate you! we killed the federation once, we can do it again. 
king: no. 
summer: no?! 
king: you and your family did enough damage to this kingdom already. 
king: if you re not gonna die. then just leave. 
princess dowry: i think that s for the best, too, morty. 
rick: great, let s fuck off, then. 
morty: oh, before we leave. please let your women marry whoever they want from now on. 
summer: they have forced marriage too? stuff like this is why i think authenticity is shit, btw. summer gets off her horse and the three of them leave through a portal. 
[int. smith family dining room. morning.] 
summer, morty and rick arrive at their home. summer leaves her helmet on the table and sits down. their lunch from medieval times is still there, and very cold. summeri’m starving again. 
morty: this is cold. 
rick: want me to heat it up again? 
summer: ew, no. 
rick: we can always go to medieval times to get new ones. 
summer: or we can go to waffle house. 
morty: yeah, that sounds good. rick perfect, let s go. post-credits scene 
[int. waffle house. morning.] 
rick, summer and morty are sitting at the table, eating very inauthentic belgian waffles and pancakes. a robber wearing a wizard hat and halloween mask barges into the building, waving his gun around. 
robber: i am belgos! the waffle house wizard! give me all your money! every customer in the building proceeds to aim their own firearm at the robber. 
rick: now this is an authentic waffle house experience! 
[int. morty's bedroom - night] 
morty lays down in his bed with a peaceful smile on his face and swiftly falls asleep. a moment later the silence of the room is broken by a ghostly apparition that appears with a shriek. 
morty: holy crap! what the..? morty shrinks under his covers as this green pulsating anomaly pulls closer. after a few seconds it abruptly disappears. morty sits frozen in shock staring at the corner of the room it came from until his alarm goes off the next morning. 
[int. rick's garage - day] 
morty walks wide-eyed into the garage while rick is building a contraption on his work bench. 
morty: uhh.. rick i need your help with something, i'm freaking out a little. 
rick: you're always freaking out morty. i've learned to tune it out. 
morty: i think i saw a ghost in my room last night. 
rick: a ghost? don't be an idiot, ghosts aren't real. 
morty: are you sure? because i thought vampires weren't real but then, you know, we found one at my school remember? and we had to kill it. remember that? rick yes morty, vampires are real. and do you wanna know an interesting bit of trivia about vampires? 
morty: uhh, sure? 
rick: they don't believe in ghosts, because vampires aren't idiots. 
morty: rick will you please just help me! something came into my room last night and it looked a lot like you'd.. think a ghost would look, so i just-- 
rick:--ugh alright alright. pipe down already. on the off chance that this"ghost"of yours is real, i ll make you a uhhh, anti-ghost... uhh.. bullet. rick starts making the bullet on his work bench. 
morty: oh, okay i guess... how would a bullet kill a ghost? 
rick: well when you gotta kill a werewolf you use silver bullets right? this is the same, you know, similar kind of thing. morty wait, werewolves are real? 
rick: of course not morty! don't be an idiot! okay there, done. rick loads the anti-ghost bullet into a revolver he pulls from an ankle holster. he tosses it over his shoulder to morty without looking. 
rick: the first bullet in there is a psychokinetic round that should kill any apparition-ey kind of thing you come across. next time the ghost shows up, just hit it with that. 
morty: cool, thank's rick. 
rick: don't mention it. oh and be careful, the second bullet is a regular one. 
[int. dining room - day] 
beth is carrying suitcases in both hands fumbling to open the front door. jerry is following behind carrying a third. 
beth: what are you holding? 
jerry:... it's your other suitcase--beth--are you kidding me jerry? you're seriously carrying my bag to the car? you're actually helping me leave? 
jerry: what i, i'm just trying to be nice. 
beth: i'm leaving to spite you jerry! i don't want you to be nice! i want you to be upset! i'm so sick of you smothering me! 
jerry: if you're intentionally trying to 4. upset me how am i the bad guy? 
beth: questions like that are exactly why i need space! beth slams the door in jerry's face and is heard peeling out of the driveway. rick walks past him to the table and sits down. 
jerry: what is wrong with me? i can never tell what she wants. 
rick: i've got a secret for you jerry, she doesn't decide what she wants you to do until you've already done something. jerrywhat? 
rick: if you didn't help her with her bags she'd accuse you of being selfish and say that's why she's leaving. since you did help, she went with the smothering thing instead. and the only common factor here is your willingness to internalize any shit that gets pushed your way. jerry drops the suitcase, hangs his head, and turns to walk away. rick notices and rolls his eyes in irritation. 
rick: ugghh. okay jerry i ll tell you what. you guys divorcing would be pretty inconvenient to my living situation so i ve got an idea. 
jerry: oh yeah? what? 
rick: you need some perspective. so let's me and you right now go to the best strip club in the multi-verse! 
jerry: i don't think so. 5. 
rick: she said it herself didn't she? she needs space. jerryright but i don't-- 
rick:--so if going to stay with a friend that lives eight blocks from here is helping, then obviously going to a galactic strip club twenty lightyears away would work even better! 
jerry: yeah but when she said space i don t think she was referring to like, physical distance right? it s more of a figurative thing isn't it? 
rick: can't sneak anything past you jerry. okay how about this. you like star wars right? 
jerry: yeah. 
rick: you know how star wars takes place long ago in a galaxy far far away? 
jerry: yeah. 
rick: spend two hours at the strip club and i'll take you to that galaxy. jerryno way! really! can we go to endor? 
rick: sure whatever. do we have a deal? 
jerry: yeah! i have to go get my jedi robes! jerry excitedly runs out of the room. 6. 
rick: jesus christ jerry, endor? no wonder she left. 
[int. morty's bedroom - day] 
morty's alarm goes off and he hits the snooze. as he lays back down, the apparition appears and disappears with a groan. morty grabs ricks revolver off his side-table and nervously scans the room. 
morty: uhh, ghost thing? if you've got like, unfinished business or whatever, that's fine. i just, i can't have you sneaking into my room while i'm sleeping. the ball of green light shimmers into existence again and softly whispers"morty"in a garbled female voice. 
morty: oh god it knows my name. okay for real, if you come in here i have to shoot you! you're no different than any other home intruder, okay? you don't get like, special treatment just because you're dead. so, leavenow. the ball is getting bigger and louder as it starts to move towards the bed. morty aims the revolver and fires. but instead of bullets, confetti sprays out. a fabric sign that reads"ghosts aren't real idiot"is sticking out of the barrel. 
morty: damn it rick! the ball of light is no longer transparent and begins whirring like an engine. it splits into two halves which then meld back together. this repeats over and over with increasing speed until the ball collapses into a flat off-green portal. summer appears in the portal and reaches out to morty. 
summer: morty! help! 
morty: summer!? morty grabs summer's outstretched hand and pulls her out of 7. the portal, which implodes and disappears behind her. 
morty: summer what the hell are you doing!? 
summer: morty! it's so good to see you! man it feels really weird to say that. summer brushes herself off. the sides of her head are shavedand when she stands up morty notices that she has a wooden peg leg. 
morty: what are you doing? where did that portal come from? 
summer: it's me morty! your real sister! 
morty: my... what? 
summer: you don't remember? morty stares blankly back at summer. 
summer: (annoyed) i'm your original sister from the dimension that got cronenberg'd. 
morty: uhhh... 
summer: remember? i mean i'm just assuming that it was you and grandpa rick that destroyed the world with one of your dumb experiments right? everyone got turned into cronenberg monsters? (beat) are you kidding me morty? are we really going to have to flashback to it? 
morty: no no wait! oh right! i remember! how did you get here? what happenedto your foot? 8. 
summer: walk with me, i want to get this done quick. is rick here? 
morty: no he's out. get what done? where are we going? summer pulls a shotgun out of a holster on her back and smashes open the door to summer's bedroom with her peg leg. 
[int. summer's bedroom] 
summer: freeze bitch! 
morty: what the hell are you doing? summer scans the room and puts her gun away when she sees no one is there. 
summer: where is she? summer starts rifling through drawers and closets in the bedroom. she grabs a diary and puts it in her back pocket. 
morty: she's at the mall. 
summer: which mall? 
morty: the one by the... wait why? 
summer: so i can kill her and take herplace in this dimension. 
morty: wh-what! you can't do that! 
summer: why not? isn't that exactly what you and grandpa did? 
morty: no they were already dead when we got here! we didn't kill anyone! 9. 
summer: yeah you"didn't kill anyone"except for almost every single person on earth when you cronenberg'd it. 
morty: that was an accident! summer walks to the garage, morty chases behind. 
[int. rick's garage] 
morty: hey wait! 
summer: an"accident"is when you run over a fire hydrant with your car. mutating and killing everyone on earth is criminal negligence. you'd be thrown in jail for it if there were any cops left to take you there. mortywe're not supposed to be in here summer! the garage is off limits, rick has been like, super clear on that. summer slides some junk out of the way to get to ricks safe. she punches in the code waits for the long and loud unlocking process to finish. 
morty: how do you know the password? 
summer: i had lots of time to guess it morty. or do you really not realize how long it's been since you abandoned me in a dimension of monsters? the safe door swings open and morty creeps towards it to peer inside. summer grabs him by the scruff of his shirt and yanks him back. a buzz-saw blade at shin level shoots out of the base of the safe narrowly missing morty's leg. 
summer: (taps peg leg with knuckles) yeah i learned that one the hard way. summer kneels down to look into the safe. the only thing inside is a stack of porn magazines. she rolls her eyes and tosses them over her shoulder revealing a button beneath. when pressed an impossibly long drawer slides out of the safe. she reaches into it and pulls out a shiny new portal gun, which she uses to fire a portal at the wall. summeryes! finally! summer pulls a yellow-tinged decrepit portal gun wrapped in duct tape out of her satchel and throws it aside. 
summer: you have no idea what a hassle it was getting here. summer walks over to morty, shotgun in one hand and new portal gun in the other. 
summer: where is she? 
[int. human-boobs strip club - night] 
rick and jerry walk through "human-boobs", the human themed alien strip club. jerry is wearing his jedi robes. 
rick: alright what do you think! 
jerry: how much longer? 
rick: two hours was the deal. and the timer doesn't start until you stop complaining. here check this out! rick leads jerry over to two vending machines under a sign that reads"fantasy scanner". 
rick: this machine will scan your brain for your dirtiest, raunchiest fantasy and then put you in a virtual reality world where you can experience it! 
 jerry: yeah i don't know if i want to--rick slams a brain scanner on jerry's head and puts another on his own. two flashes go off and the machine spits out two tickets. 
rick: alright lets do this! here's yours. just go in that booth and put this ticket in the machine. rick hands jerry a ticket and the two walk into separate booths. rick puts his ticket in and hit's the"start"button. the walls of the booth fade away. 
[int. virtual reality strip club] 
rick is sitting in front of a stage watching a blonde stripper pole-dance. 
rick: this is it? i feel like my brain can be a lot raunchier than this. when the stripper turns around rick sees it's a virtual reality beth. 
rick: oh jesus christ! 
beth: hey there handsome.. rick slams the stop button and the booth reappears around him. 
[int. human-boobs strip club] 
rick: what the hell is this!? he pulls the ticket back out of the machine. it's stamped with a picture of jerry. rickoh god damn it. you grabbed the wrong ticket jerry, you idiot! arrg it's going to take me forever to get that image out of my head. rick gets out of his booth and starts walking around to jerry's. 
rick: and is your raunchiest fantasy seriously your own wife stripping for you? i mean there's"vanilla"and then there's"flavorless". jerry crawls out of the booth in a state of shock clenching the other ticket in his hand. he's shivering so hard he has trouble standing up. 
rick: oh boy. how we doin'jerry? you okay? what did you see? jerry slowly turns his thousand yard stare towards rick. 
rick: can you hear me jerry? do you still want to go to endor? jerry shakes his head no. 
rick: you want to get a drink? 
jerry: yes. drink now. liquor now. rickokay pal, here we go. this way. yeah i'm actually not sure which one of us was more traumatized by this. 
[int. rick's garage - day] 
morty backs away from summer until he bumps into the wall behind him. 
summer: which mall did she go to? 
morty: i uhh.. i don't think i should tell you. i.. i can't just let you kill her. 
summer: why? apparently you were okay with leaving me to die. we're interchangeable to you so what's the difference? 
morty: i mean, i don't know, it feels weird. she was here when mr. poopybutthole got shot, and when we ruptured space time and all that. we've like, been through stuff together, you know? 
summer: don't worry, i'll read all about it. summer tosses the diary up and down in her hand. 
summer: okay look morty i'm super sorry you made memories with your new fake sister, but you do realize that they'd be our memories if you had come back to get me in the first place right? this is your mess i'm cleaning up, so you could at least tell me where she is. 
morty: i.. i don't.. i just, we should wait for rick to get back. 
summer: oh, i get it. that's the difference isn't it? this time you would have to be the one to take responsibility. 
morty: what? 
summer: because thats what s important to you morty. you don t care if your sister dies or gets marooned in a hell dimension forever so long as you aren't morally culpable for it. you ll let rick do whatever needs to be done, and then tell yourself you d have done different so you can maintain your self-image as a good person. 
morty: no no that's not-- 
 summer:--well i got news for you! your complete indifference to your sister s suffering makes you a bad person whether you are the one causing it or not! it would have taken like, two minutes to come get me. you re no better than grampa-rick, except he doesn t claim to be a good person. 
morty: i don t know! it s really confusing! this is all being dropped on me at once you know?. i m sorry we didn t come back for you, i realize that was wrong now. but p.. please, you can t kill my sister-- 
summer:--i m your sister! and i want my life back! if you've got another solution let's hear it. 
morty: can't you like, just say you're her long lost twin or something? you know? you guys could like, get a bunk bed or-- 
summer:--i'm not sharing a room with that bitch! why should i be the one that has to live half a life? and i'm not asking for your blessing on this, if you won't help me i llfind her myself. summer shoots a portal and tries to jump through it. morty tackles her and knocks the portal-gun out of her hand. the portal closes and the two wrestle for control of the gun. after a short scuffle summer tosses morty off of her and pulls out her shotgun. morty backs away and puts his hands up. summer wipes blood off her lip. 
summer: why didn't you fight this hard for me morty? summer opens a portal and jumps through. morty is left alone in the garage. 
morty: no! 
[int. human-boobs strip club bar] 
jerry is slumped over the bar and barely present. rick pats him on the back. 
rick: okay jerry, i don't know exactly what you saw in there but it's probably best for both of us if you forget it, so take these. rick pours three vials of glowing liquid into jerry's glass. the substance violently fizzles and and steams on contact. 
rick: this will make you forget everything that happened today. drink it. jerry snatches the glass off the table chugs the entire thing in one gulp. 
jerry: this stuff better work. what's it called? 
rick: it's called a roofie jerry. i bought them from the bum behind the seven-eleven. rick's phone gets a call from morty. 
rick: what up. 
morty: rick come quick! i need your help! come to the garage! 
rick: i'm twenty lightyears away, can this wait? 
morty: no come to the garage! hurry! 
rick: uggh. rick hangs up the phone and shoots a portal. jerry is lying face down on the bar top. 
rick: hold on a sec i'll be right back. and try not to swallow your tongue. int. rick's garage-day 
a portal opens in the garage and rick steps out of it still holding his cocktail. 
rick: alright, what's so important. 
morty: i don t have time to explain, i need you to portal me somewhere! 
rick: that s why you called me here? do you see me wearing a chauffeur hat morty? 
morty: rick! 
rick: no you don t. and there s a very specific reason for that. 
morty: it s an emergency! 
rick: no an emergency is what you called me away from. your dad is alone in an alien bar having a mental breakdown. it's not a safe place for someone in his state of mind. or just his mind in general. 
morty: you don t understand! the version of my sister we left behind on the world we rick--i don t have time for exposition morty, just tell me where you want to go. 
morty: the mall downtown. 
rick: the mall? are you kidding me? what kind of emergency could possibly necessitate you going to the mall?. you run out of yellow shirts? rick punches buttons into his portal gun and fires a portal onto the wall. 
rick: there. don't ever pull this crap again morty. 
morty: thanks rick! morty jumps through the portal, rick shouts after him. 
rick: and my garage is off limits by the way! i thought i ve been like, super clear on that! 
[int. mall - day] 
morty rushes through the mall shouting for summer while trying to call her on his phone. 
[ext. mall courtyard - day] 
summer sees that morty is calling, and rolls her eyes before hitting ignore. a shadowy figure walks up behind her. 
[int. mall - daymorty] 
damn it summer pick up the phone! you're going to stuck-up yourself to death! morty hears a shriek on the second level of the mall and runs up the escalator. when he reaches the top he sees the source of the shriek is an obnoxious ad display. out the window, he spots summer on the ground in the courtyard below surrounded by paramedics. 
morty: oh god no! morty rushes back down stairs but gets stuck on a crowded escalator. by the time he gets outside, the ambulance is rushing off with summer inside. morty takes the space phone out of his pocket and tries to call rick again. while waiting for rick to answer, he sees an empty car idling nearby with keys in it's ignition. 
morty: pick up, pick up, pick up! 
[int. human-boobs strip club bar - day] 
rick sees that morty is calling, and rolls his eyes before hitting ignore. 
rick: how we doing man? 
jerry: you were right rick. she walks on me because i let her. and she hates me because i let her. 
rick: of course i was right. jerryshe doesn't want a sidekick, she wants a partner. and i've always known that but it's scary to rock the boat when our relationship is hanging on by a thread. right now she hates me, but not enough to leave. what if the transition from the jerry i am to an assertive jerry she'd like more is so rocky she leaves before it's over? 
rick: life is risk jerry, you'll get there one day. 
jerry: are you kidding? i'm there now. beth leaving me isn't half as terrifying as what i saw here today. 
rick: well let's not be dramatic. 
jerry: i could walk in on her having a threesome with my parents and it would only be the second most shocking thing i've seen in my life. i mean seriously what is wrong with your brain? 
rick: my brain? glass houses jerry. jerryno, i'm not going to settle for the bare minimum anymore. for her sake and mine, i'm going to be better. i'm going to make myself the man we both want me to be! 
rick: i m really happy you had this little break through jerry, but i'll remind you that you took a triple dose of roofies like half an hour ago. so try to enjoy your new perspective while you can still remember it. 
jerry: oh that's right. hey, do you have like, a pen or something? 
[ext. hospital parking lot - day] 
morty slams his stolen car into a fire hydrant outside the hospital and rushes inside. 
[int. summers hopsital room - day] 
morty is panting and can barely talk when he gets to summer's bedside. she is unconscious with a bandage wrapped around her head. 
morty: oh god, what happened? 
doctor: some psycho attacked her with a machete and ran off. are you family? 
morty: yes she's my sister. is she going to be--morty trails off when he sees that summer's foot has beencut off. 
morty: what? no, no! i don't understand! morty backs slowly into the hallway in a state of shock. down the hall behind him, a silhouette of a person holding a portal gun stands watching. when morty notices, he bolts the other way. a portal is shot open in his path. he tries to slow down to avoid it but topples over the edge and falls in. 
[ext. wasteland - sunset] 
morty falls out of the portal and slams into the ground. summer drops out shortly after brandishing her shotgun. 
morty: y.. you cut off her leg. why did you do that!? 
summer: think about it dum-dum, how else could i explain this to everyone? summer gestures to her peg leg. 
summer: not only am i all of a sudden inexplicably missing a foot, but it's also already healed completely? people would ask questions. 
morty: but i.. there has got to be a better way. 
summer: the better way was for you and grandpa rick to find a dimension with room for the whole family in the first place. now there's justthis. morty looks around at the vast desert surrounding him. 
morty: where are we? 
summer: guess. while taking in his surroundings morty backs into something. he turns to see three crude tombstones, two bearing his parents names, and a third that reads"fake summer"over an open grave. 
morty: oh god! summer this is crazy! this is insane! 
summer: the universe is crazy morty, it's best to just not think about it. summer puts her shotgun back in its holster, and sits down leaning against a boulder. she pulls out the diary and starts flipping through it. 
summer: i need you to answer some questions for me. what does she mean by"worked for the devil?". was that like a nickname or something? morty is staring awestruck at the graves. 
summer: morty! focus! are you going to help me or not? considering this is all your fault anyway i feel like it'sthe least you can do. 
morty: wh.. what happens now? 
summer: what happens now is i wait. in a few months when fake summer's leg is healed i'll portal into her room one night while everyone's sleeping and... well, you get the idea. (beat) and the next morning life will carry on like normal. no one will know it happened. not even you. 
morty: so every time i go to bed from now on i'm just going to be laying there not knowing if you're down the hall at that very moment murdering my sister? h.. how am i supposed to sleep at night? 
summer: i don't know how you slept at night before knowing you left me here. 
morty: i can't let-- 
summer:--this is happening morty. there's nothing you can do about it now. 
morty: w.. well, maybe i'll tell rick! i'll tell him you broke into hissafe! y.. you think he's gonna be okay with some, rouge summer going around with a stolen portal gun killing people? 
summer: well, do whatever you think is right. after a long silence summer looks up from the diary to see morty staring transfixed at the gravesite. she shakes her head in annoyance and fires a portal next to him. 
summer: go home morty. morty lingers for a moment, looking longingly at the graves before dejectedly walking into the portal. 
summer: i'll see you real soon. 
[ext. smith house front yard - sunset] 
morty steps out of the portal into the driveway. he takes out his phone to see dozens of texts telling him to come to the hospital. he puts his hands in his pockets and starts walking down the sidewalk. 
[ext. hospital parking lot - night] 
morty walks by the car he crashed, which is being loaded onto a tow truck. water is spewing out of the broken hydrant. 
[int. summers hopsital room - night] 
morty walks into the hospital room. beth and rick are sitting on either side of summer's bed. jerry comes in with coffee for everyone, beth shoots him a loving smile as he hands her a cup. jerry sits down next to rick. 
rick: see jerry? all you needed was some space. also i guess a massivetragedy never hurts when trying to bring people together. kind of got lucky with the timing on that one. summer is leafing through a catalog of prosthetic legs. morty walks over to rick and tugs on his jacket. 
morty: rick i.. i need to talk to you. 
rick: jesus, you look like hell. 
morty: just come on already. the two walk out into the hallway. 
rick: what morty, is there another emergency ? where do you have to go this time? amusement park? 
morty: no i.. begin flashback-beth and jerry's gravesite morty recalls the transcription on the memorial plate at the gravesite, which reads it took the world ending to bring us together, and now, once again, we re apart. here lies jerry and beth smith. the best, albeit only, parents on earth. one way or another, i ll be with you again soon.-summer smith"back to scene 
morty: i uhh.. 
rick: jesus morty only you could stutter when not speaking. morty 
i.. : morty lets out a defeated sigh and hangs his head. 
morty: nothing. i don't know. never mind. morty walks back into the hospital room and sits next to his sister. 
rick: i love our little talks morty! rick snags a bouquet of flowers off a passing cart and brings them to summer. 
[int. dining room, smith home - day] 
jerry tries to spark up a conversation as morty, beth, and summer flatly pick at their breakfast. 
jerry: well, summer? anything fun going on with you these days? 
summer: dad, let s not do this. who benefits from these conversations? 
beth: it s not about you, he just wants to feel"fun". it s always about him. 
jerry: where is this coming from? rick enters. 
rick: (belch) let s go, morty. 
morty: uh... where? 
rick: seriously, morty? where? is there any place in the cosmos less boring than this room? morty gets up to leave. 
jerry: wait a minute. why do you guys get to do all cool space stuff? 
rick: cause i built a spaceship with my huge brain-the same brain that tells me not to bring you along. rick and morty leave. 
beth: just let them go, jerry. 
jerry: no. we re having fun whether you like it or not! jerry takes beth and summer s hands, and pulls them out the door. 
[int. rick’s spaceship] 
rick and morty sit in the front of the ship as they approach a tiny, industrialized, orange planet. 
morty: where are we going, rick? 
rick: i told you, morty. straight ahead there is the planet diddlydat. it s a storage facility for brain saves. 
morty: brain saves? 
rick: yeah, they save brains, morty. you can pay them to download all the information from your brain and save it to a new brain. then, when you inevitably die a pathetic death, they put your brain into a new body and activate it, morty. 
morty: w-whaddaya you mean, activate it? like they copy your brain and bring it back to life? 
rick: (belch) jesus morty, yes! how complicated is this? cloning, replicating, whatever you wanna call it. this is the human equivalent of backing up your hard drive. 
morty: but that s crazy, rick. wouldn t your reactivated copies live on forever? 
rick: ugh, they re not just copies, they re you in every meaningful way. are you anti-immortality? 
morty: well, i don t know... yeah? 
rick: brain saves are a completely natural step of evolution, morty. humans used to be stuck with just one option for eternal life-spitting out disappointing kids that vaguely resemble them. now, with just a single brain cell, we can make exact replicas of our best and brightest intergalactic specimens, namely, me. the ship lands, and a muffled noise comes from the back. 
morty: what was that? rick turns around and pulls up a hatch in the floor of the spaceship, revealing jerry, beth, and summer crammed into the tight crawlspace, hot and flustered. 
jerry: (hopeful) surprise? 
rick: so this is why my parsecs-per-gallon were so crappy. jerry, beth, and summer crawl out of the crawlspace and into the rear seats. 
jerry: we re here! diddilydat sounds fun, right guys? 
rick: no way you re coming with. you snuck onto my ship, now you re gonna stay here and guard it. enjoy the view or whatever. it s not my fault you can t entertain your family. rick and morty exit. 
jerry: well, this is new, right? do any of your friends dads bring them to space parking lots? 
summer: i can t believe i gave up my day for this. 
beth: i gave up more than you. as they talk, they fail to notice a group of two-foot tall orange creatures that start to poke around the ship curiously. 
jerry: let s not view this as giving up a day, let s view it as a vacation! we re on a planet in another galaxy! 
summer: (unimpressed) i gave up vince s house party for this. and there s a chance he would ve changed his mind and invited me. 
beth: get pregnant at 17, then you ll know what i gave up a whole generation of boys like vince, and career goals, and a thin waist. 
jerry: (frustrated) alright, fine. let s just all be grumpy forever. 
beth: maybe you d be grumpy too if you ever had to sacrifice anything. the tiny orange creatures open the top of the spaceship to see inside. 
jerry: are you kidding? i ve sacrificed so much for this family! 
beth: liar. the orange creatures gasp. 
creature: grab them!! the creatures grab jerry, beth, and summer, then carry them away. 
beth: what s happening?! 
creature: the male has been accused of dishonesty! he must face trial for his crimes! 
[ext. diddlydat security checkpoint - day] 
rick and morty approach a group of the orange creatures operating a security checkpoint. one of them greets rick andmorty. 
sciddilyscat: (bright and jolly customer service rep-played by simon pegg) welcome to diddlydat! i m sciddilyscat, how can i help you? 
rick: one brain save. let s make this quick. 
morty: are you sure about this, rick? this is a big decision. isn t it, like, unnatural? 
rick: no. 
sciddilyscat: i assure you, it s extremely safe and precise. we re now able to make a perfect replica using just a single brain cell. 
morty: but are you sure that s such a good idea? w-what does your life really mean if it can end and then just start up again like nothing happened? 
sciddilyscat: not to worry, pal. life is meaningless. (upbeat) and now it lasts forever! 
morty: that-that doesn t really sound better... 
sciddilyscat: think of it this way. how many brilliant, useful ideas have been lost to the wind just because a few people died? on your earth, wouldn t the dark ages be a little lighter if they still knew how to build roman aqueducts? would you struggle to produce energy if tesla were still alive? would you still laugh at mike tyson cameos if you remembered he was a convicted rapist? 
rick: see, morty? this is valuable stuff. 
sciddilyscat: indeed it is. we give justice to the dead-a chance to return to the world of the living. that s why the fee is eh... substantial. 
rick: how substantial are we talking? 
sciddilyscat: 40, 000 mounda-glops. 
rick: jesus! last year it was 500 micro-glibs! 
sciddilyscat: i m sorry, but with increased demand and limited space, prices have skyrocketed. 
rick: i can t afford that! come on, morty, let s go home and pretend we re not dying. morty gives a sigh of relief. rick and morty walk back to the ship. sciddilyscat looks around suspiciously at the other aliens. he sneaks off to grab rick before they leave. 
sciddilyscat: (to rick, suddenly very quiet and serious) if you re unable to pay, there is one other option. but it s a bit off the books. 
rick: i m listening... 
morty: i m not! let s get outta here, rick. 
sciddilyscat: i believe in what we do here. we preserve all the incredible knowledge from the brilliant thinkers that the universe has collected over countless years. this is the library of alexandria for the modern age. this planet is what makes our lives worth living. we re not dust in the wind anymore. 
rick: what s your point? 
sciddilyscat: not everyone who comes here is good. sure, we get scientists and philosophers, but inside this planet there are saved brains of murderers and villains from across the galaxy. 
rick: and you want me to fix them? 
sciddilyscat: i want you to fix one. an evil creature came here years ago and saved his brain. his name was vern-dor schplern-mor. he was killed in a blaze of glory last moon cycle. but of course, we reactivated his brain save, and now he s at large again. for him, this planet is just a checkpoint in his murderous video-game-of-a-life. 
rick: (unimpressed) look, i m all in favor of fighting monsters, but i can t just go around constantly saving planets. it ll ruin my"interstellar fugitive"reputation. 
sciddilyscat: one of his victims was my wife. 
rick: a revenge mission? (belch) hmm... i could get behind that. i m in. 
sciddilyscat: you ll have to break in on your own. i can t help you there. but once you re inside, place this device on his brain and get outta there. sciddilyscat hands rick a small, metallic, handheld device. 
sciddilyscat: this is a fliddilyflat. once it s turned on, it ll melt straight through his brain. you do this favor for me, and i ll get you a free brain save. (pointing rick s portal gun.) you better give me that first. it won t get past security. rick hands over the portal gun. sciddilyscat returns to his group. 
rick: whaddaya say, morty? wanna break into a brain fortress, morty? wanna kill a super villain, morty? all for my own selfish reasons, morty?? 
morty: no! obviously no! i ve been against this the whole time! 
rick: (belch) we re doing it, morty. commercial break. 9. 
[int. brain repository] 
rick and morty peek around the corner, into the repository. it’s a giant underground library filled with countless bookshelves holding glass jars of brains. every 10 feet, there is a body blank - a nondescript body ready to accept a brain and become activated. at the opposite end of the repository is a brain labeled vern-dor schplern-mor. 20 diddlydat guards and security checkpoints stand in between them and vern-dor schplern-mor. one diddilydat takes a dna sample and places it in a slot to download the info to a blank brain. another diddilydat takes a brain off the shelf and places it into a body blank. the body quickly morphs into a humanoid figure, and it walks out of the repository. 
morty: how is this gonna work, rick? there s so many of them! rick sneaks up behind the first guard and knocks him out with a headlock. he drags the body behind a shelf and moves quickly along the wall, followed by morty. 
morty: did you just kill that guy? 
rick: relax, morty. he s probably got a brain save. the only reason diddilydats developed this technology is because they re so easy to kill. they re like the opposite of cockroaches. 
morty: i really don t like this, rick. what if we get caught?? 
rick: we re not gonna get caught, because i m the smartest being in the universe, and i will always out-maneuver these simple-minded creatures! rick and morty keep running until a diddlydat guard jumps out in front of them. 
riddilyrat: hey, you re not supposed to be down here. what s your name? who let you in? you know what, wait right here while i call my sup-rick kicks the tiny riddilyrat in the face, and he falls to the ground screaming. rick and morty continue running. 
morty: (sarcastic) wow, you re so smart, rick! 
rick: bad example, alright, morty? i m still f king brilliant! i m gonna outsmart every guard in here! 
[int. interrogation room] 
a crowd of diddilydats sit around a large operating theater, looking down at jerry, beth, and summer in the center. jerry gets strapped down to a metal chair. 
jerry: let me go! this is crazy! 
giddilygat: (announcing to the crowd) the male faces charges of dishonesty. 
jerry: why do you care? i don t even live here! 
giddilygat: diddilydats are the most easily killable species in the galaxy. as a deterrent to violent attacks, our justice system must be swift and uncompromising. bring forth the lie detector! a diddilydat rolls out a big robotic arm device and places it next to jerry. a thin needle extends from the robotic arm and it drills into jerry s temple, into his brain. 
jerry: ah! it s in my head! 
summer: stop this! 
beth: please! let him go! giddilygat ignores their pleas and takes jerry s wallet from his pocket. 
giddilygat: are you jerry smith? 
jerry: yes, but please let me outta- 
lie detector: (authoritative deep voice-think benedict cumberbatch) true. 
summer: we re from earth! we have rights! you can t just drill into our heads like a bunch of experimental animals! 
beth: i didn t mean to call him a liar. this whole thing is a misunderstanding. 
giddilygat: is today what you would call,"friday?" 
jerry: yes. i just wanna go ho-lie detectortrue. 
summer: we re americans! you can t just treat us like illegals! 
beth: (running out of ideas) i retract my accusation! does that work? can i do that? 
giddilygat: have you ever sacrificed anything to be with beth? jerry hesitates. beth notices and gets angry. 
summer: i wanna talk to your space president or whatever! this is an outrage! 
beth: answer the question, jerry. 
jerry: beth, aliens just put a screwdriver in my brain, and you re still stuck on this stupid argument?!? 
beth: answer it! 
jerry: yes! i ve sacrificed! lie detector 
lie. : the diddilydats hoot and holler like the crowd at a monster truck rally. beth is heartbroken. 
jerry: no! that s impossible! i m telling the truth! the lie detector is wrong! the diddilydats gasp and go silent. 
giddilygat: the lie detector has been accused of dishonesty! 
lie detector: (suddenly flustered) wait... what? 
cut to: jerry s still hooked up to the lie detector, which is now also strapped down to a metal chair. giddilygat wheels in a 2nd lie detector. a drop of blood oozes from jerry s temple-wound. he grabs beth s shirt sleeve and wipes it off. 
beth: what the hell?! 
jerry: i m bleeding brain chunks! i m not thinking straight!! beth seethes with anger. summer paces back and forth, deep in thought. lie detector 2 drills into lie detector 1 s metallic casing. 
lie detector 1: ow! get out of my processor! 
giddilygat: let s try this again. are you jerry smith? 
jerry: yes. lie detector 1 tries to defend himself the same way jerry did. 
lie detector 1: true. but come on, mates. you know me! i- 
lie detector 2: (even louder, more authoritative) true. 
giddilygat: is today what you would call,"friday?" 
jerry: yes. 
lie detector: true. guys, we ve been so long! did all those neural spike boot camp nothing? 1 friends for days at meanlie detector 2true. 
beth: (impatiently) go on, ask him the real question. 
giddilygat: have you ever sacrificed for- 
summer: (interrupting and clearly thinking hard) dad, what would the first lie detector say if you told a lie? 
jerry: uh... lie? lie detector 1true. 
lie detector 2: lie! the crowd gasps. lie detector 1 pulls out of jerry s brain and points at lie detector 2. 
lie detector 1: he s wrong! this lie detector is lying!! 
lie detector 2: (caught off guard) huh? no way, mate! the crowd of diddilydats goes into a full on riot flipping chairs, fighting each other, throwing things in every direction. 
diddilydat 1: (from the crowd) 
what s become of our justice: system?! 
diddilydat 2: (from the crowd) justice is dead!! 
diddilydat 3: (from the crowd, pointing at the smiths) it s their fault! get them!! 
jerry: we gotta get outta here! sciddilyscat emerges from the crowd and grabs them. 
sciddilyscat: come with me! i know a way out! they follow sciddilyscat out of the operating theater down a dark hallway. 
[int. brain repository] 
rick is ruthlessly pummeling a dozen diddilydat guards. he picks one of them up and uses him as a bowling ball to knock down three others. rick continues to festively beat the helpless diddilydats to oblivion. morty holds himself in the fetal position in the corner. two diddilydats argue with each other. 
kiddilykat: we never prepared for this! he s a giant! 
widdilywat: shut the f k up, kiddilykat! 
kiddilykat: you shut the f k up, widdilywat! i told you this would happen! 
widdilywat: blow it out your ass! you never gave our department the funds we needed to protect ourselves from this kind of attack! 
kiddilykat: f k you, i know you steal from your grandma and blame it on the nursing home! rick slams kiddilykat s and widdilywat s heads together, then throws them onto a large pile of unconscious diddilydats. the room is quiet. rick catches his breath. morty emerges from the corner. 
rick: (gasping for air) i m the sm-the smartest- (belch) smartest guy, right here (belch). i m the smartest. rick takes a swig from his flask. 
morty: this is horrible, rick. just get the vern-dor guy, and let s get outta here. rick and morty walk up to vern-dor schplern-mor s brain. 
rick: so you re in favor of brain saves now? 
morty: no, i just don t wanna get caught for space crimes or whatever, and you just beat up a bunch of tiny policemen, so i wanna leave now! 
rick: jeez, morty. you don t see any value in saving memories? are you against books too? you re doing great things for society, morty. 
morty: you don t care about any kind of value to society. you only want a brain save so you can keep living, because you think you re so smart! 
rick: (upset) yeah, morty! i think i m really smart, morty! and that endorsement really means something. you know why, morty? because it came from me, and i m (belch) smart, morty!! 
morty: let s get this over with. they reach vern-dor schplern-mor s brain. rick places the fliddilyflat device from sciddilyscat on the glass. he pushes the button, and the device lights up, displaying the word,"activated". it begins to heat up, melting the glass encasing the brain. 
rick: happy, morty? let s get outta here so i can get my free save. rick and morty head for the exit, but a giant glass door slams shut, blocking their way. sciddilyscat stands on the other side of the door. 
rick: what gives? i just got your (belch) revenge for you. open up. 
sciddilyscat: i m sorry, rick. i m afraid i haven t been honest with you. yes, that was vern-dor schplern-mor s brain. but he has others, and there s no way of telling how many extra brains he might have saved using fake names. 
morty: what does he mean, rick? 
sciddilyscat: don t you get it? as long as this planet exists, he ll always come back to life. i can t get justice until every single brain on diddilydat is destroyed! rick looks behind him. the fliddilyflat device has not only destroyed vern-dor schplern-mor s brain, but it s started a fiery chain reaction, spreading to the brains around it, gaining fuel and growing every second. 
rick: so you wanna destroy this place? great! i don t care! just let us out! 
sciddilyscat: oh no, rick. you re the most important piece of this puzzle. when the authorities investigate how this whole planet got destroyed, who are they going to blame, the innocent customer service rep, or the interstellar fugitive, rick sanchez?! 
morty: oh no, rick! 
rick: quiet, morty! 
sciddilyscat: buh-bye now. you ve got 6 minutes before that reaction reaches the core and blows the entire planet to pieces. feel free to use that time saying your goodbyes-not that it ll matter when you re incinerated and your unsaved brains are lost forever. oh right, one more thing. i m gonna leave them here with you. can t have witnesses. sciddilyscat presses a button, and jerry, beth, and summer fall through a trapdoor into the repository beside rick and morty. sciddilyscat leaves. 
morty: aw jeez, rick! i told you we shouldn t be here! 
rick: thanks for that brilliant input, morty! no wonder you don t like brain saves-you ve never had a single thought worth saving in your life! commercial break. 
[int. brain repository] 
rick, morty, jerry, beth, and summer are locked inside. the fire continues to grow. 
morty: what re we gonna do, rick? we re trapped! 
rick: i don t know, morty! let me think! 
summer: i m never gonna make it to vince s party! 
beth: i can t believe i gave up my milf years just to die in an alien storage facility. 
jerry: does no one believe that i ve sacrificed for this family?! 
rick: quiet! everyone quiet! do you want me to save your lives, or pretend to sympathize about missing a party that you weren t even invited to? 
morty: (angrily mocking) yeah, guys. everyone listen to rick. he knows everything. he s the smartest smart guy in the whole world of smarts. 
rick: that s right! 
morty: well you know what? i m not smart! i m just a stupid morty! but at least i know when to ask for help! morty runs towards the growing fire. 
rick: morty!! they run after him, and find morty pushing a brain labeled"klom-klom"into a body blank. 
rick: what re you doing, morty? 
morty: i m getting help! we re stuck, but maybe one of these brains can get us out. the body activates and morphs into a tall purple alien with big, watery eyes. 
morty: how do we get outta here? klom-klom looks at the fire. 
klom-klom: (shouting to the heavens) you were wrong about me, dad! i m not just a waste of frectal-klom fluid! i m a hero!! klom-klom sprints into the fire and gets immediately consumed. the fire absorbs him, then a burst of flames erupt from the spot he entered. 
beth: see, jerry? that was a sacrifice. 
jerry: that was a suicide! 
rick: (to morty) so you are in favor of brain saves! 
morty: only because i don t wanna die! there must be some brain in here that can save us! 
rick: dammit, morty. i wanna eviscerate you for flip-flopping, but we re actually on the same page here. rick grabs a brain labeled"lesterplatt"and puts it into a body blank. 
rick: (yelling to no one in particular) only doing this cause i don t wanna (belch) die! clearly not admitting my own limitations and reaching out to others for assistance! rick s blank morphs into a yellow alien that looks like a spider, but with elephant trunks for legs. 
lesterplatt: (to rick) you gave me life! you are my creator! tell me your commandments, and i ll pressure my friends and family to follow them! 
rick: can you get us out of here? 
lesterplatt: no. 
rick: then go forth and multiply! lesterplatt sprints up and down the repository, randomly putting brains into body blanks. everyone does the same, and they yell at the newly activated bodies, looking for help. morty activates philoso-ferby, a pink ferby doll. 
morty: how do we get outta here? 
philoso-ferby: (slow, far away voice) i find that the best way to discover new paths... is by getting lost. 
rick: you activated a philosopher?! we re trying to escape real life danger, morty, not design inspirational posters! rick activates pinyottoman, a colorfully decorated ottoman. 
rick: how do we get outta here?! 
pinyottoman: (angry) you re looking to me for advice?? i m an ottoman stuffed full of candy!! beth activates participation trophy wife, a slightly ugly pale alien. 
beth: how do we get outta here? 
participation trophy wife: (calm) we don t. we re gonna die. but we did our best. no shame in settling! jerry activates panic roommates, a two-headed pathetic creature. 
jerry: how do we get outta here?! 
panic roommates: (in unison) ah! we re gonna die! where s the panic room?! why did we ever leave the panic room?! summer activates private jangletrot, an incompetent alien military teenager. 
summer: how do we get outta here? 
private jangletrot: (cripplingly nervous) i don t know... call in an air strike!? 
summer: how would that help?! 
private jangletrot: uh... call in two air strikes!? 
summer: you re terrible at this! 
private jangletrot: i m just a private! ask general admission! summer activates general admission, a mean-looking alien drill sergeant. 
summer: how do we get outta here?! 
general admission: (suddenly crying) i can t keep it secret anymore! when i was 10 i spilled a soda in the cafeteria and blamed it on a kid with down syndrome! 
summer: you two are in the military?! how has your planet survived this long?! the repository is now filled with a hundred different reactivated beings, all the while, the fire growing larger. 
rick: (screaming out to everyone) how do we get outta here?! a reactivated female diddilydat comes forward. 
tiddilytat: there s an emergency exit! this way! tiddilytat runs towards an exit, and the family follows. 
rick: how do you know that? 
tiddilytat: i used to work here. they round a corner into a hidden hallway. a huge crashing sound erupts from the repository. rick, morty, and tiddilytat look back to check it out. a 10 foot tall, red alien is rampaging through the crowd of reanimated beings, crushing them like ants. he slashes pinyottoman in half, sending candy flying in all directions. the fire grows, consuming almost the entire room. 
rick: pinyottoman! noo! 
tiddilytat: (terrified) that s vern-dor schplern-mor! we gotta get outta here now!! 
morty: (to rick) you reanimated vern-dor schplern-mor?! i thought you destroyed his brain? 
rick: sciddilyscat was right! vern-dor schplern-mor had backups! they continue down the hidden hallway. 
[int. emergency exit] 
rick, morty, jerry, beth, summer, and the tiddilytat enter a concrete room with a glass exit hatch on the ceiling. there are more brains and body blanks lining the walls. 
tiddilytat: this way! they get to the hatch, but sciddilyscat appears again and locks it shut. he has rick s portal gun. 
rick: again?! why haven t you left yet?! what s wrong with you?! i m framing you for destroying my home planet. did you think i would sciddilyscat let you escape? i will have justice, or-sciddilyscat sees tiddilytat and freezes. 
sciddilyscat: (shocked) tiddilytat?! you re alive?! 
jerry: you two know each other? 
sciddilyscat: she s my wife! (to tiddilytat, panicked) i didn t know you saved your brain! i-i already sealed the door! i can t open it!! 
tiddilytat: it s ok. at least i got to see you one last time. you need to leave before this whole place blows. 
sciddilyscat: but i can t lose you again! 
tiddilytat: if you die, none of this will matter. it won t be remembered. 
sciddilyscat: i would give up every memory for another second with you. if life is meaningless, what s the point of living forever?! 
tiddilytat: just remember me as i am in this moment at peace, and totally, completely in love. remember this moment, and-vern-dor schplern-mor breaks through the wall and gives a terrifying roar. the raging fire is a just a few feet behind him. vern-dor schplern-mor grabs tiddilytat by the leg and throws her into the fire. the fire absorbs her, then a burst of flames erupt from the spot she entered. the burst breaks open a small hole in the sealed exit door. 
sciddilyscat: nnooooooooooo!!! sciddilyscat jumps through the hole in the door, into the room, leaving the portal gun outside the exit. sciddilyscat charges at vern-dor schplern-mor with a knife like a madman. he heroically battles vern-dor schplern-mor like a knight fighting a dragon-dodging and cutting him with incredible speed. rick, morty, and summer take the opportunity to squeeze through the small hole in the exit. 
sciddilyscat: i will have justice!! sciddilyscat stabs vern-dor schplern-mor through the eye, killing him. without missing a beat, he cuts open vern-dor schplern-mor s brain and starts eating it like he was starving to death. 
sciddilyscat: yeah, you like that, mutherf ker?! you gunna bounce back from this one, bitch?! 
morty: (horrified) oh my god, what s he doing, rick? 
rick: revenge is satisfying, morty, not pretty, or even logical. beth tries to climb through the exit, but she can t fit through. she gets down to the floor again. 
beth: this is your fault, jerry! i coulda fit through here if my hips didn t have to bear your children! the fire closes in. jerry takes a deep breath. 
jerry: beth, you re right. i haven t sacrificed anything for you. but it s not because i don t love you. it s because you were always the best thing that could ve happened to me. jerry throws himself into the fire. the fire absorbs him, then a burst of flames erupt from the spot he entered, opening up the sealed exit door large enough for beth to escape. morty and summer scream, beth stands still, completely in shock. outside the exit, rick grabs the portal gun and opens a portal. 
rick: let s go, beth! right now! 
beth: (heartbroken) but, jerry! the fire closes in, just seconds away from killing beth. 
rick: you can t save him! it s too late! beth gets an idea. she rips off the part of her sleeve where jerry had wiped his head blood. she grabs a blank brain and stuffs the sleeve into the slot. 
rick: beth! now or never! rick, morty, and summer jump through the portal. beth grabs a body blank and jams the brain in. the body starts to morph. beth throws the body through the portal, then dives through the portal herself, just barely escaping the flames. the portal closes behind her. in the background, a string of eight lie detectors get blown to pieces while calling each other liars. the planet diddilydat erupts in an apocalyptic explosion, destroying everything in sight. 
[int. dining room, smith home - day] 
beth picks herself off the floor and frantically looks around. rick, morty, and summer are safe. 
beth: (worried) where s jerry? jerry stands up, disoriented. 
beth: jerry! you re alive! beth hugs jerry. 
jerry: am i? how did i get here? did i die? i feel the same... but very different. morty and summer join in on the hug. 
morty: we did it! 
summer: i love you guys! 
rick: (sarcastic) hurray. we wiped out the greatest knowledge repository in the history of intelligent (belch) life. but thank god jerry s alright. (belch) the end.

beth, jerry, summer, and rick are sitting around the table getting ready to eat dinner. 
jerry: beth, honey, isn t morty coming down for dinner? 
beth: i called him five minutes ago, jerry. 
jerry: oh, so because our son didn t hear you call him once, he has to starve to death? 
summmer: chill out, dad. 
beth: yeah, jerry. if you re so concerned for morty, why don t you go get him? 
jerry: that s not the point... 
rick: i think we all know why morty s still in his room and hasn t come down for dinner yet. rick makes jerk-off motions. 
summmer: ew, grandpa. that s disgusting. 
beth: it s not disgusting, summer. it s... natural... beth zones out for beat. i need to go check something on amazon quick. she grabs her glass of wine and hurries to the living room. jerry looks at her in suspicion. 
jerry: okay... 
rick: fuck yeah! 
summmer: way to be subtle, mom. you re being even grosser than grandpa now. 
rick: as if that s even possible. what what! he tries to give summer a high five but she just sits there with her arms folded. jerry sighs loudly. 
jerry: fine. i ll go get morty.

morty: ah, geez... n-not right now, dad. i-i m not that hungry. 
jerry: now listen, son. i know what you re doing in there to yourself might feel good, but i m a little concerned about what you re doing it... uh... in reference to. there s a lot of dangerous websites out there, son. 
morty: dad, n-now s really not a good time. c-can you do me a favor and get grandpa rick? it s really important that you do. jerry sighs. 
jerry: i m just worried about you, morty. that s all. jerry walks back downstairs, defeated. cut to

rick: geez, morty. have some goddamn humility. do you know how old i am? do you know how many times i ve made god cry in my life? huh? d-do you? cuz it s a whole lot, morty... a whole lot. 
morty: yeah, but i... i c-can t do it in... 
rick: everybody jerks off, morty. everybody. every fucked up space creature. every planet. e-every dimension. every alternate timeline. hell, i ve been to dimensions where it s weird to not constantly jerk-off. burps spent a few months there and still, despite my incessant need to always have my hand on my penis, was seen as a non-masturbating creep to everyone in that dimension and was burps forced out. look, what i m saying is, i ve never met anyone who didn t masturbate. case closed. cut to

beth is sitting on the couch with her laptop on her lap, sipping on her wine. she has a huge smile on her face. jerry walks in. 
jerry: beth, uh... aren t you gonna finish eating dinner? 
beth: not now, jerry. i ve got some shopping to do. oh, that looks like a fun one. 
jerry: wh-what are you shopping for exactly, sweetie? 
beth: a... a personal massager. 
jerry: what? why would you need one of those? those things are a waste of money. i can give you a massage, beth. there s more than one reason they called jerry smith,"señor magic fingers"in college. 
beth: what was the other reason? 
jerry: i m sorry? beth sighs. 
beth: what was the other reason they called you... god, i can t believe i m saying this..."señor magic fingers"in college? 
jerry: uh, look, can we, uh, just stick to the conversation at hand for now? it s a long story and the point still stands. jerry smith, your husband, can give you the best darn massage of your entire life! 
beth: not like this thing can. (beat). oh yeah, definitely not like this thing can. 
jerry: oh, so i see what s going on here, beth. you re getting a... a dildo! 
beth: jerry, plenty of women my age have one. it s not a big deal. 
jerry: wha... not a big deal? not a big deal? this is the final nail in the coffin that is our marriage. nay! this is the dildo in our coffin. 
beth: if you really think a dildo is the thing that s going to make or break this marriage, you need to re-evaluate your life, jerry! beth leaves the living room. 
jerry: (calling after her) well at least i m not a dirty, filthy... masturbator! have fun replacing my close to perfectly functional penis with your new devil stick, beth. at that moment, summer walks into the living room. oh, hey, summer. what cha got planned for tonight? summer runs out of the house screaming. cut to

the stone cherub has crept a little closer to morty. 
morty: oh, god, rick! it s... i-it s getting closer! 
rick: well, it ll keep getting closer unless you start jerking off again. 
morty: w-what? i don t get it, what s happening here? 
rick: look, morty. we ve done a lot of dimension hopping together, and sometimes the residual dimensional energy you pick up can be transferred through electronics. it seems like this time, you accidentally accessed the dark matter net and set one of these bad boys loose. 
morty: i was just browsing reddit, i swear! 
rick: that s what they all say. besides,"reddit means something completely different on the dark matter net, morty. trust me, there s some super dark shit on there, morty. suuuuper dark shit. like super dark shit so super burps fucking dark y-you didn t even think you wanted to see it! it changes you, morty... 
morty: well, w-what the hell is that thing anyway? some sort of outer space stone murder angel? 
rick: they re called,"peeping cherubs."one of the oldest, burps and therefore creepiest creatures in the whole freakin universe. they re quantum trapped until someone accesses their cloud on the dark matter net. once that happens, they re invisible to the naked eye unless someone around them starts jerking off. the only reason we can see this one now is because you still have your hand on your junk and it thinks you re masturbating. but these things are fucking smart, morty. i-it ll figure out soon enough that you aren t and then... 
morty: th-then what, rick? 
rick: then you re fuuuuuuucked, morty. 
morty: seriously? oh, god, grandpa rick, i-i don t wanna die tonight. e-especially not like this! 
rick: oh, you won t die, morty. burps i mean you will, but it ll just be excruciatingly horrifying. 
[rick takes out his flask and starts to down the entire thing.] 
morty: why would you say"but it ll just be excruciatingly horrifying?"don t you mean"and excruciatingly horrifying?"oh, geez. making that correction out loud didn t change how i felt about the situation at all! rick finishes what s in his flask and burps loudly. 
rick: see, morty, these things, th-they feed off of potential"masturbatory energy."i-imagine every last drop of that happy juice you were trying to get out manually earlier being sucked out involuntarily. and, a-and not the good kind of sucking either, morty. imagine you juiced an orange and the orange had a skeleton and every time you made orange juice, burps you had a skeleton left over. now imagine that b-but ten billion times worse and with your jizz and skeleton. a bird appears on the windowsill next to the peeping cherub. a beat later, the bird explodes. blood and semen fly everywhere. kinda like that. burps but worse. morty starts crying. 
rick: better save up you might need anyway, i need figure out how mess. those tears, morty. em later. burps to go refill and to take care of this 
morty: aw, geez, rick. d-don t leave me alone in here with this pedo-angel. 
rick: calm down, morty. these things don t strictly target burps the rick underage. we re all real fucked if we don t figure this out. just give me some time. 
morty: w-what do i do in the meantime? 
rick: geez, morty. h-haven t you been listening to literally anything i ve been fucking saying? morty turns his attention to the cherub and shakes nervously. oh. right. that thing. just just keep your hand on your morty. for the love of god. your. hand. on. your. dick. peace! burps dick, keep.

rick is at his work bench constructing something. jerry knocks and walks in. 
rick: let me ask you something, jerry. w-why the hell even knock if you re just gonna walk in anyway? huh? e-either knock o-or just come in! 
jerry: uh, sorry rick, but can i talk to you for a minute? i could really use your, uh, sage, advice. 
rick: sage advice, huh? r-really, really digging deep for burps that one, jerry. i m kinda doing something important here. can it wait? 
jerry: it s about beth. rick looks up from working and sighs. 
rick: what happened this time? 
jerry: well, you see... ugh, this is so embarrassing. 
rick: spit it out, jerry. shit is about to hit the fan in a big way. y-you understand? diarrhea is about to get all up in the central air. you feel me? th-that s a lot of fucking shit to clean up, man. lot of burps fuckin shit. 
jerry: okay. okay. sighs nervously beth is... beth is buying a dildo. 
rick: what? i-is that...? fuuuuuck you, man. fuck. you. 
jerry: wh-what did i say? 
rick: i don t need to hear about my daughter. yeah, that s right. your wife, my daughter, buying a goddamn dildo, jerry. rick turns and starts working at his bench again. especially not when your son is about to get all of the semen forcibly removed from his body. 
jerry: what? rick sighs and stops working. 
rick: look. just tell beth how you feel about it and get the hell out of here. 
jerry: you know beth, rick. once she makes a decision about something, it takes an act of god to get her to change her mind. (beat). besides, i ve already tried telling her how i feel and she just doesn t care. 
rick: did you, jerry? (beat). did you? 
jerry: (annoyed) yes. rick starts working again. 
rick: then stop being a pussy and get over it. peace! he kicks jerry out. jerry sighs.

morty: oh, thank god, grandpa rick. you re back! rick walks in with the gadget he was working on in the garage. he starts setting it up in between morty and the cherub. 
rick: god, morty. if you somehow survive today, you better not grow up to be like your dad. c-cuz i swear to everything that is sacred in the multiverse i will beat the ever-living shit out of you. y-y-you hear me morty? i will fuck you up! 
morty: somehow survive? th-there s gotta be a way out of this. i mean, you always figure out how to save the day, rick... right? 
rick: calm your shit, morty. of course i ve figured out a way to save the day. it s real simple. 
morty: wh-what do i have to do? 
rick: lick my balls, morty. 
morty: wh-wh-what? 
rick: lick my fucking, balls. morty looks traumatized. rick bursts out laughing. ah ha ha. oh man! burps y-you, you should ve seen your face. i m just fucking with you, morty. a little interdimensional inside joke. just keep doing what i told you and everything should be fine. 
morty: w-well that s the thing, grandpa rick. it s starting to get a little... uh, complicated. 
rick: w-w-what the hell do you mean,"complicated?"now s really not the time to start getting coy, morty. you have your dick in your hand and you re talking to your grandpa in front of a cum-draining stone cherub for fuck s sake! 
morty: gee, grandpa rick. w-well, when you put it that way, it... it s just that, if i keep going, well, eventually... y-you know... rick drops what he s doing. 
rick: morty. morty. whatever you do. do not blow your load in front of this, this masturbangel. y-you hear me, boy? you do not blow your load under any burps circumstances. 
morty: ah, geez. w-what happens if i do? rick gets back to work. 
rick: it ll attract the rest of that guy s host. do you have any idea what that fucking means? w-what that could mean for the rest of our galaxy? best case scenario we have to blow up earth to save the rest of the galaxy from getting devoured by these things. 
morty: jesus christ, rick! 
rick: i know, morty. you fucked up reaaaal big this time. 
morty: me? me? th-th-this is all your fault. it s always your fault. you... y-you stupid piece of shit! fuck you, grandpa! rick s gadget begins to malfunction. 
rick: dammit! my invention isn t working. be burps right back. rick rushes out. 
morty: i hope you don t come back at all. y-you octogenarian shithead. i can hold this thing off myself. i-i could do this all day. i ve done it all day ple-plenty of times. i... i... ohhhhh god. oh geez. oh... morty breathes in deeply and smiles. suddenly, in the space between the first cherub and morty s bed, more cherubs begin popping in.

rick is trying to fix the new gadget he’s invented. beth knocks on the door. 
beth: dad, i know you re probably busy with some universe saving invention, but can i talk to you for a minute? 
rick: come on in, beth. you know i always have a minute for my little girl. (beat). but seriously, only a minute. if your son is anything like i think jerry probably is, that s probably all the time we have. 
beth: what does that... nevermind. that s actually why i came here to talk to you. jerry s been freaking out all night because... 
rick: i m gonna stop you right there, beth. look. you re my daughter. i burps love you to death. but don t you think this is one of those situations where it s a little too personal for your father to be getting involved? 
beth: oh... my god. oh my god! did jerry already come in here and tell you why we ve been fighting? 
rick: (annoyed) yes. does that honestly surprise you? 
beth: (angry) ugh! of course he would come straight to you. i wasn t going to tell you the, uh, intimate details about our fight but i still needed some advice. do you think it s... wrong? 
rick: you heard me at dinner, beth. you know how i feel about all that good stuff. it s just jerry being a little insecure bitch as usual. 
beth: but he s my little insecure bitch. 
rick: exactly. so do what you wanna do. he ll get over it eventually. or not. whatever. he s your problem, not mine. beth seems disappointed with rick s answer. rick sighs. look, right now, our whole galaxy, nay, the whole universe, nay, the horse universe, is in danger of getting real fucked up, beth. real fucked up. but do i seem that stressed to you? 
beth: well, maybe a little. 
rick: trust me, i ve dealt with a helluva lot worse. the point is, i m dealing with it. not worrying. not complaining. not freaking out about a burps dildo. i may be your father, beth, but you re also an adult now. i mean this with complete and total love when i say deal with your own fucking problems and leave everyone else the hell out of it. 
beth: that was... surprisingly inspiring, dad. thank you. she kisses him on the cheek. by the way, what was up with morty before? is everything okay?

jerry: you know... like a, like a fake vagina? a creep in a trenchcoat in the next aisle peeks his head up. 
employee: we don t sell those here. 
jerry: are you kidding me? i need one by tonight! you see, my wife decided that she wanted to buy a dildo--as if our marriage wasn t in jeopardy enough--and her father thinks it s fine but i think it s outrageous that she even thought of the idea. you know what i m saying? and then my son won t stop masturbating for even a second to eat dinner! jerry sighs. i guess what i m just trying to say is...

jerry: (excited) you mean? 
creep: yes. fake woman hole. just for you, my friend. he pulls out what looks to be a fleshlight. 
jerry: is that it? 
creep: yup. only used once. guaranteed to be having good time. 
jerry: how much is this gonna cost me? 
creep: for you my weeping friend, fifty dollar american. cash only. no refund.

rick, morty, jerry, and summer are sitting around the breakfast table eating together. rick is seated beside morty on one side of the table. jerry is at one head of the table, and summer is seated on the side of the table opposite rick and morty. beth enters from o.s., wearing her white surgical coat. 
beth: okay, summer, morty, finish up eating so we can get to the hospital. we have a full day ahead of us. 
summer: (dryly) remind me again why we have to spend our day off from school going to work with you? 
beth: because, summer, it s take your child to work day. and the more you complain, the slower the day is going to go. so let s just accept that this is happening, okay? 
summer: (sighs) fine. 
jerry: (to beth) okay, beth, remind me again how come the kids are automatically spending the day with you? maybe they d like to spend some time learning about their old man s career instead. close on beth 
beth: (dryly) jerry, you re a freelance advertiser. freelance as in you re not working right now. i want the kids to get some kind of productive experience out of today. so please just let this go. close on jerry 
jerry: (sighs, similar to summer) fine. 
[angle on rick, morty, and beth]
(suddenly, rick pushes back his chair and lets out a loud belch. he stands up and stretches.)
rick: well, i ll be doing my part for this inane celebration of mediocrity by taking morty to work with me like usual. let s go, morty. beth moves toward rick with a scowl. morty remains in his seat, looking from rick to beth uneasily. 
beth: dad, you can t take morty with you. today he s mine. close on rick 
rick: (sarcastically) oh gee, where s morty going to have the more productive day passing out while watching you carve up a horse s heart or pushing the boundaries of science with me? hmm... rick holds his hands out to either side, moving them up and down like they are two sides of a scale he s trying to balance. angle on rick, morty, and beth 
beth: dad, you couldn t take morty today even if you wanted to because it s take your child to work day, and morty is my child. (grins smugly) 
rick: (dryly) okay, well, here s a counterpoint you re my child, so why don t you just come along with morty and me? medium on beth 
beth: (blinks) you... you want me to come with you and morty on an adventure? angle on rick and morty 
rick: (shrugs) yeah, sure, why not? now let s get moving. come on, morty. rick heads across the kitchen. morty hesitates but then stands up and follows after him.

beth: um... okay, dad. 
angle on rick and morty: traveling as rick and morty head to the kitchen exit. 
morty: (sotto) rick, are you sure it s a good idea to take my mom on an adventure? 
rick: (sotto) don t worry, morty, i ve got it covered. rick and morty leave the kitchen together. 
[full on beth, summer, and jerry]
(beth smiles and turns to summer) 
beth: summer, would you mind going on an adventure with grandpa rick today instead of going to the horse hospital? summer <scoffs> and pulls out her phone. 
summer: uh, no thanks, i ve already been on a rick adventure. i m not going back for another round. i ll just stay here and go to work with dad. 
beth: (sighs) fine, suit yourself and get nothing out of this day. hey!

rick and morty enter the garage. after a beat, beth enters as well. rick starts searching through some of his gadgets while morty and beth stand near the doorway. morty looks uneasily from beth to rick. beth smiles, looking around. 
beth: you know, morty, i always wanted to go on an adventure with your grandpa. my favorite daydream was about us time travelling. i even used to research temporal science in high school. 
angle on rick: rick glances over his shoulder at beth. he has his portal gun in one hand and a dark visor with buttons and blinking lights in the other. (note the visor has a strap around the back of it). 
rick: (scowls) who-ho-ho, hold on there, beth. let s make one thing clear right now. i don t do time travel. it s cliché, it s messy, and i want no part of it. period. 
angle on beth: beth rolls her eyes as she takes a few more steps into the garage and starts examining some gadgets. 
beth: fine, dad, then what do you want to do today? rick enters from o. s., approaching beth from behind. suddenly, he pounces forward and gets the goggles over her eyes. 
beth: (shocked) dad! what the beth is cut off as rick presses a few buttons on the visor. when he s done, rick steps back, and beth just stands there, quiet and smiling. 
angle on morty and beth: morty runs in front of beth and waves his hands in front of her face to get her attention, but she doesn t react. 
morty: (panicky) oh jeez, rick, what the heck did you do to my mom?! full on everyone 
rick: relax, morty. i made that visor using simulation technology i swiped from the zigerian scammers. no matter where we take her or what happens, she ll process it as a digital illusion of whatever will make her happy. watch. (clears throat, smiles and looks to beth) yo, beth, i think horses are stupid! angle on beth 
beth: (smiles) aw, thank you, dad. i love you too! 
rick: (to morty) see? now come on, we ve got a full day ahead of us. we re going to the great trading bazaar on the planet fergenrinar. rick makes some adjustments to his portal gun. morty <sighs> but takes beth s arm to guide her. 
morty: and why are we going there, rick? 
rick: to secure a very necessary and rare item, morty. there s no time now, i ll explain it to you later. rick uses his gun to create a portal and then jumps through it. morty hesitates but then goes through after him, pulling along a still-grinning beth. cut to

jerry: so... summer. how s everything going? angle on summer 
summer: (doesn t look up from her phone) fine. 
full on summer and jerry: hold on summer and jerry for a couple beats of awkward silence. the summer suddenly stands up, closes her phone, and grabs her purse off of the coffee table. 
summer: well, this has been fun , but i m heading out to the mall. a few of my friends parents are on welfare, so they don t have to go to work with anyone today either. jerry springs up out of his seat. he grins sheepishly and rubs the back of his neck. 
jerry: wait, summer! don t you want to at least try doing a little potentially career-oriented bonding with your old man? or any kind of bonding? come on, what do i have to do to get you to stay? 
summer: (very seriously) i want my curfew extended. i m sixteen, ten o clock isn t cutting it anymore. close on jerry

rick, morty, and beth appear at the heart of the fergenrinar bazaar. the ground is dusty, the sky has two suns, and there is various <walla> from the aliens all around. the streets are lined with stalls full of items while aliens of multiple shapes and sizes walk around completing trades with each other. morty seems nervous while beth just smiles in response to her simulation. 
rick: welcome to fergenrinar the premiere trade trope planet of the galaxy. shouldn t take us more than a couple of hours to get what i m looking for. 
morty: (blinks) hours?! rick, why can t we just buy the thing you want and go?! come on, just this once, for the sake of my mom, can this adventure be a simple one? 
angle on rick: rick shakes his head as he takes a gps device out of his pocket and starts checking some coordinates on it. 
rick: morty, this is a trade trope planet. you can t just buy things here! we ve got to go through a series of elaborate trades to get what we want. sure, it s an overly complicated system. but hey, so is capitalism... public education... organized religion... beth and jerry s marriage. angle on rick, morty, and beth 
morty: (rolls eyes) okay, okay, rick, i get it. 
rick: great, then let s get started already. i ve got the coordinates for our first trade. rick heads o. s. down the street. morty follows o. s. after him. hold on beth just standing there (still smiling) for a beat. then morty runs back in from o. s., grabs beth s arm, and pulls her along o. s. to catch up with rick. 
main street of bazaar: traveling as rick leads morty and beth through the main street of the bazaar. he is still tinkering with his gps device. 
morty: rick, are you sure my mom ll be okay staying in that simulation? i mean, it s not going to give her brain cancer or something, is it? close on rick 
rick: (shrugs) probably not. close on morty and beth 
morty: (eyes wide) rick! 
[angle on rick, morty, and beth]
(rick sighs deeply and puts away his gps device) 
rick: she ll be fine, morty. right now she s probably lost in a fantasy about riding horses or being queen of the time travelling knocked up teenagers or something. it s all good. (glances to beth) beth, you having a good time? 
close on beth: push in on beth who smiles brightly. ripple dissolve to 
[ext. beth’s simulation – continuous] 
beth is sitting in a large, wooden boat in the middle of the ocean with a rick simulation and a morty simulation in a mr. peabody-style digital simulation. she smiles as she takes in the scenery. the rick and morty simulations are very enthusiastic and always smiling brightly whenever they interact with beth no matter what they say.angle on beth 
beth: wow, dad, i can t believe we ve time travelled all the way back to columbus s discovery of america in 1492 and that we re actually on the santa maria! widen to include rick simulation on right 
rick simulation: actually, beth, columbus wasn t a discoverer so much as a money-hungry opportunist who ravaged a continent for personal gain. widen to include morty simulation on left 
morty simulation: yeah, mom, and let s not forget how he brought plagues of illness onto an entire race of humanity. 
rick: yup, he was a real sick son of a bitch, honey! beth looks from the rick simulation to the morty simulation with an eyebrow raised. 
beth: uh, well... yes, i guess that s all true. but, still, it s just exciting to be here in the past seeing history! angle on rick simulation 
rick simulation: are the high seas definitely your first choice for an adventure though, beth? i mean, we could go wherever the hell you want. angle on morty simulation 
morty simulation: yeah, mom, we just want you to be happy.

summer: (dryly, raises an eyebrow) seriously? 
jerry: it s the only alternative to us bonding that ll make me happy and that ll prove to your mom that i didn t waste your whole day.

rick: all right, one cosmic snipe. (to blue alien) a pleasure doing business. (to morty) come on, morty, we ve got to get this thing one block up to trade for an andromedean orchid. 
two shot: rick and morty morty scowls and doesn t move forward. he lets go of beth to hold out his arms.

rick: one drop of that glorious concoction can leave you wrecked for days, morty. days. 
two shot: rick and morty as morty replies, beth wanders off o. s. 
morty: (angrily) you dragged us to this death trap bazaar and messed with my mom s head all for a bottle of alcohol?! rick <scoffs> and rolls his eyes. in the background, beth is clearly visible several dozen feet away from rick and morty, wandering around with a big grin on her face and bumping into aliens. 
rick: yeah, well, for someone who cares so much about his mom, you re doing a really crappy job of keeping her from wandering off in a delusional state across an alien planet... (looks to beth, dryly)... and there go the robotic slave traders scooping her up as their latest catch. 
morty: (blinks, looks to beth) wait, what?!

jerry: i m looking for something to give your mother for our anniversary, son.

rick: you ve really screwed the pooch this time, morty. oh boy. how long have you been playing? 
morty: just-just a few hours. rick, we can t just--we re going to save them, right? i-i-i i mean, if they re real, we have to save them? 
rick: sorry, morty, you re too far along. they re doomed. that s part of the plan. you see, morty, we can t just go around deciding what lives and what dies. that s not how it works. you have to let things work themselves out burp naturally sometimes. 
morty: ahh! come on, rick, that doesn t-that doesn t-that s not fair. all those people are going to die because of me! 
rick: it s the circle of life, morty. things are born and things die. rick takes in his flask before giving taking a big pull.

jerry: beth, this was always a dream of yours! 
beth: no, jerry, this was a dream of yours, remember? you watched that documentary on ysenia peralta, went out and bought that ridiculous shirt and never went? 
jerry: oh right. well you are always saying we should try new things? beth starts to give in. she s too tired to hurt jerry s feelings. 
beth: fine. fine. let s just go. 
jerry: great! can you drive? i want to sit in the back so the seat belt won t wrinkle mi camisa! beth just closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.

rick: north mortyopolis? there are multiple burp mortyopolis es? outside the window we see the statue of liberty but with rick s face. suddenly, the crotch area comes crashing to the ground. we pan up to see the entire city. it looks to be in ruin. buildings are burning, smoke rising and people rioting. 
morty: oh no! we-we-we-i need to fix this! they land in front of the stairs of a large capital building complete with pillars and exit the ship. there is a loud thump. we look back in the ship to see one of rick s bottles of booze sitting motionless. another loud thump and the liquid in the bottle ripples a-la jurassic park. 
rick: ok, president morty, i think it s time to send this dimension back into burp oblivion. rick takes out his portal gun. 
morty: wait! not not yet, rick. just just give me a second. we see what was causing the thumps a very large angry mob marching on the capital building. we now see the marching mob close up and the people look like pixelated minecraft versions of normal people. suddenly, horns and trumpets can be heard from inside the capital building and a plump, mustached, futuristic dressed man (this is president nitzo) comes down the stairs followed by secret service type guards. 
president nitzo: alas our god, morty, has finally heard our prayers! this is the great morty our elders have spoken about for centuries! horrah, horrah! all of the guards bow to morty. 
morty: uhhh... y-yes? 
president nitzo: surely he has come to restore order to north mortyopolis and help us conquer those savage south mortyopolisians?

morty: the angry mob is getting very close to the steps when suddenly a massive colosseum style arena appears right on top of them. the mob is crushed to pieces and few remain. screams can be heard as the survivors scramble to recover their body parts. 
[int. double dip salsa studio] 
rick: nice work, morty. blasting them would have been quicker but i guess genocide is genocide at the end of the burp day. jerry and beth stand single-file with a few other couples. señor romantico (ricky martin type with a big silver earring) stands in the center of the room. jerry ooo ooo me me! ri 
señor romantico: hola, clase, i will be your seductor, ahem, instructor señor romantico. tonight s class will be muy magnifico! first i will need a volunteer to--jerry steps out front in his ridiculous outfit. 
señor romantico: how about you, señorita? señor romantico motions towards beth. she is apprehensive. señorita, i promise i will not bite... at least not when we dance! 
jerry: oh come on! 
beth: jerry! yes, señor romantico, i would love to dance with you. 
señor romantico: excelente! everyone else grab your partner and bring them to the center. all of the other couples go up and jerry is left by himself. then we hear what sounds like an old rusty windmill creaking and a very old lady in a wheelchair (this is babs) appears next to jerry. he forces a smile. 
jerry: (sarcastically) great. she grabs his hand and they walk roll towards the others. 
señor romantico: for our first move i need the hombres to place their hands here and here. he places one hand on beth s back and one right on her ass. beth blushes. he spins her with excellent precision and the class gasps! babs oh! that s real nice. 
jerry: muy... disapointado. ri we see that jerry is uncomfortable with beth s situation but becomes even more uncomfortable when his old lady partner grabs his hands and puts them on her. 
[ext. north mortyopolis - capital building] 
morty stands terrified looking at the destruction he’s caused. 
president nitzo: all hail, the mighty morty, who cast out the unbelieving rioters and brought the safety, prosperity and a new arena to the land! 
morty: what? i-i didn t meant to destroy anything i-- 
rick: oh, boy, morty. you re becoming a regular burp musselini right before my eyes. 
balinda: citizens in the capital are dying of dysentery. would you like to build build more hospitals? 
morty: uhhh--no! no more, no more anything. this isn t what i thought. i m not a like god, i can barely do long-long-math. president nitzo moves in close to morty and puts an arm around his shoulder. 
president nitzo: kind, generous morty. you wouldn t let the citizens of north mortyopolis perish would you? we need you, morty. you are the key to our civilization. without you there is no hope. ri 
morty: you know, pres-president nitzo, i ve been thinking. maybe the reason things are going so poorly is because you-you never stop and think for yourselves. like, you don t even have a hospital, man. this is, this is like a big city to not already have a hospital or nothing. rick begins jumping around taunting president nitzo. 
rick: whoa ho ho! you tell em burp , morty! yeah, how do you like that, bitch! make your own shit! rick takes a pull from his flask but it s empty. uh oh. let s get out of here, morty, i m all out of my favorite rick-coction. 
morty: i think you re right, rick. let s blow this worl-worl-place. we hear the sound of all of the guards cocking their guns. 
president nitzo: not so fast, morty. you didn t think we would just let you leave did you? guards! take them to the war room! suddenly, we hear the sound of a large spaceship and everyone looks up. several blasts fire down from the ship which clears out president nitzo and the guards. rick and morty stand huddled together. a tractor beam engulfs them and they ascend into the ship. don t let them get away! the guards begin firing at the above ship but it flies off. rick and morty stand in the cargo hold of the ship. int. south mortyopolis spaceshipri 
rick: i swear, morty, if we get raped on this ship. i just-i don t think i could ever forgive you for that. a door opens and soldiers come pouring out in formation. yep, we re getting raped. rick begins to unbuckle his pants. they circle rick and morty, guns drawn. following the troops is their eye patch wearing leader. this is general devero. 
general devero: morty smith? uh-uh yes? morty 
general devero: i m general devero of south mortyopolis. we ve been expecting you. 
rick: lose your pants, morty, it ll make things much quicker. trust me. rick s pants are at his ankles. uhhh-ooo! morty 
[int. smith household - living room] 
summer is on the couch watching tv. jerry and beth enter. 
beth: it was your present to me, right? and it was your idea in the first place. 
jerry: oh, put it on me! that s just great. you basically make love to rico suavè during a dance class and it s my fault! summer keeps turning the volume up trying to watch her show. jerry well, if it s dating advice you re looking for, you should just ask your mother. apparently she just can t turn it off. ri 
summer: oh my god, you guys! could you please shut up! if i m not caught up on my dating show i m ruined! i won t be able to show my face at school. 
beth: oh that s enough, jerry! i went with you to that stupid class against my will and it blew up in your face. oh, and by the way, i m going again tomorrow night. it s the advanced class so maybe you should just sit this one out. 
jerry: i--you--what-- 
summer: you guys! shh! 
beth: i m taking a bath. alone. happy anniversary, honey. beth exits. jerry paces mumbling to himself. 
jerry: advanced class. ha! i ll show them. i ll show all of them. 
[int. garage] 
(jerry suddenly gets an idea and stops pacing. jerry, now wearing just a white tank top and pants walks past all of rick's gadgets.)
(it looks like he's going for the easy way out)
(he keeps walking past all of rick s stuff and we see a large boom box sitting on a table. there s a bandana strung across the top that jerry ties around his head before pressing play. )
[int. garage-jerry montage] 
(the whole montage is to what a feeling and is completely mocking the actual music video.)
(jerry grabs a mop and begins dancing with it. he has a welding mask on and sparks are coming up from something he is working on at rick's desk.)
(he is now dancing with the mop again. he tries to spin it away but looses control as it goes flying to the ground. he is now sitting on a chair,  head back as he gets doused with water in slow motion.)
(more welding. he tries to spin the mop again and this time pulls it off. he jumps up in the air throwing his fist up and we freeze on it) 
[int. garage - later] 
rick is sweaty from his session. he has a towel draped around his neck. he winks and then we pan over to see that he’s winking at the mop in the corner. we then see what he was welding. it’s a tiny earring like señor romantico’s. he tries to put it in his ear. 
jerry: ow ow ouch! 
[int. south mortyopolis spaceship] 
rick and morty are now in the spaceship meeting room. there is a circular table where the south mortyopolis leaders sit. 
general devero: now that we have god on our side, those north mortyopolis ass holes will crawl back into the cold damp place they came out of! 
rick: i know a warm damp place you can all go to. it s my ass. i was talking about my ass in case you didn t burp know that. commander bazaar general devero, you said this was our god, our creator, morty? ri 
morty: he-hey, you know, i m not really a god. i m just morty, you know? i don t think i should get involved in-- 
general devero: commander bazaar, i can promise you this is the god we seek. creator of all things, bringer of wealth and prosperity. i saw him deliver a new arena to north mortyopolis at the small cost of only a thousand citizens. 
commander bazaar: i see. uhhh--the leaders begin to argue, speaking at the same time. 
morty: devero. general devero 
rick: (to morty) better let me take it from here burp , morty, grandpa has to get back to earth dimension c-137 before--well, just follow my lead. (to the group) generals and what nots, i m rick sanchez from earth dimension c-137. i think i know what you seek and this god morty is not it. generalll... 
rick: general devero burp right, what you need to annihilate those sons a bitches north mortyopolians are nuclear weapons. 
commander bazaar: nuclear...? commander bazaar we demand nuclear weapons! ri 
rick: right, nuclear weapons. trust me, where i come from we use them all the time. now burp , as the god morty says, ask and thou shall receive . 
balinda: several cities require nuclear weapons. would you like to build nuclear weapon plants? 
morty: uh-uh, rick, i don t-this doesn t sound like a good idea. i mean, how-what are we going to do? 
rick: trust me, morty. some civilizations are doomed from the start. sometimes you just have to burp give them what they have coming complete destruction. it happens more than you d think. you can t save everyone, morty. sometimes you just have to let life take it s natural course. you can prolong life but ultimately death burp comes calling. 
morty: jeez, rick, that s pretty, that s pretty, i think you re on to something with that. (to balinda) yes, build nuclear weapons. we hear a mario brothers esque power up sound. 
general devero: commander, missiles are armed and ready! 
commander bazaar: fire at will! int. north mortyopolis command center 
president nitzo: immediately! ri 
missile controller: president nitzo, we have obtained nuclear weapons. should we initiate the launch sequence? 
[int. south mortyopolis spaceship] 
rick and morty are running away from the command center. 
rick: come on, morty, we burp have to get out of here! they jump in an escape pod and take off. 
[int. escape pod] 
rick and morty are both staring out the windows. it’s chaos below. things are getting blown up and there are mushroom clouds everywhere. it’s even worse than before. we see rick’s ship at the north mortyopolis capital and they descend down to it. 
[ext. north mortyopolis - capital building] 
buildings are crumbling, cars crashing and there’s smoke everywhere. rick and morty land the escape pod and run towards the ship. the ship remains in tact but not for long. they’re standing outside the ship and see everything crumble. rick pulls out his flask. 
rick: morty, there s something i have to tell you. back there when i said we control our own burp life? i have an incurable disease, morty. it sucks. i take this to control it but i could go at any minute. 
morty: oh man, rick, that s-that s like not good. ri 
rick: i know, morty, that s why we have to make the most of our time and not worry about blowing other people up. just let them do what they want and don t expect burp some god to save you. suddenly president nitzo walks out tattered with a gun pointed at rick and morty. there are several soldiers with him also pointing guns. 
president nitzo: not so fast, morty, god of all things! 
[int. double dip salsa studio - the next day] 
señor romantico is standing in front of the class again. 
señor romantico: hòla, clasè, welcome to advanced salsa and--oh, beth! it s great to see you again, señorita! (purrs like a cat) why don t we start off with a little demonstration for the class, no? suddenly, jerry bursts into the front of the class. his chest is puffed out and his ear is swollen and bloody from piercing it on his own. 
jerry: i think i ll handle the demonstration tonight, señor romantico. beth, may i have this dance? beth is skittish but turned on by jerry s balls... figuratively. 
beth: oh, jerry, i don t-- 
jerry: hit it, babs! babs, the lady in the wheelchair from before, hits play on a boombox. jerry begins dancing with beth showing expert precision. ri finally it s time for jerry to spin her. we go to slow-mo. jerry takes her in, sweat beginning to form on his forehead. señor romantico s mouth is wide open as he looks on. jerry goes for the spin and pulls it off! he pulls beth in close. 
beth: muy caliente! señor romantico walks up between them and puts his arms around them. 
señor romantico: jerry! you, my friend, are my new protege! a salsa fred astaire! i would kiss you but i m gay and i don t want you to get weird. 
jerry: you re gay? 
beth: come on, jerry, look at his chest. he has the grace of a swan and manicured like a gourmet hot dog. let s get out of here. 
jerry: well, i thought--now! 
beth: they run off, beth dragging jerry by the arm. 
[ext. double dip salsa studio - parking lot] 
jerry and beth are inside their parked car. it’s shaking and the windows are fogged up. they are having sex. hot, passionate, the time you were 16 and brought your crush to finger blast point sex. 
[ext. north mortyopolis - capital building] 
president nitzo has his gun on rick and morty. 
president nitzo: you will save us from this imminent doom or--ri a large piece of rubble falls and crushes nitzo and his men. rick takes a last look at his flask then tosses it on the ground. rick and morty climb into the ship and fly off through a portal.

summer is sitting on the couch again watching tv. we see the show she’s watching. 
tv show voice: on tonight s all new episode of, hey bro, i m actually a bro . 
bro  1: hey, bro, i m actually a bro. 
bro  2: no f ing way, bro! jerry and beth walk in looking like they just had sex because they just had sex. 
beth: maybe later we can try... beth whispers into jerry s ear. 
jerry: oh ho! me gusta! 
[int. garage] 
the garage is empty before the garage door opens and rick and morty’s ship comes flying in. they land and get out. rick immediately goes to his liquor cabinet trying to find a bottle that isn’t empty. he finds one and begins chugging it. morty is slow to get out and still staring at the screen of the game. we see what morty is seeing. there is still pandemonium everything is blown up and it all looks like sara connors dream sequence from terminator 2. 
morty: aw, crap, i think i missed like a whole day of school for this, rick. morty no. not this time. they-they had it coming and they ll just have to figure it out on their own. ri 
balinda: your world is in imminent danger. would you like to build a space ship to transport the survivors? morty presses a button and the whole screen goes white. 
rick: and so burp it shall be.

the whole family is on the couch watching tv. we are now looking at the screen. it looks like survivor. 
tv show: tonight on an all new, let s put people in a weird place and play god , pierce and melanie are in trouble! 
pierce: we have no food, no water, no shelter and possibly dieing from rattlesnake bites. 
melanie: eh, someone will probably come help us. pierce and melanie both lie down and stare up at the sky. 
morty: uhh that s-they can t just-just do that! oh man. i think i m going to be sick. i ll be in my room. morty exits. 
jerry: what s wrong with him? 
rick: beats me, jerry, but one thing is for sure those two people are burp fu--title closing credits ri

jerry smith takes a roll of packing tape and tapes a box shut. he puts his fists against his hips looking down at it, confident. beth stands in the door way. 
beth: this is really it, isn t it? jerry turns around. 
jerry: (beat) if you decide it to be... yeah. this is pretty much as it as it gets. jerry picks up his box. 
beth: look, jerry... it s not that i don t-- 
jerry: yeah, the obligation to our kids is strong on this end too. 
beth: you just don t know what it was like when mom... rick was never the same. sure, he s a drunk mad scientist now, but when she was gone? he was-- 
jerry: a meaner drunk mad scientist? you don t have to explain anything, beth. we need time a part. i hold no ill will toward you for picking your father over the father of our two beautiful children--mostly. it s not your fault! rick s a parasite who deeply ingrains himself into the psyche of the ones he loves. it s no wonder why i never got infected. 
beth: (beat) yeah. jerry walks out of the room. beth follows.

jerry walks towards the open door. seen in the drive way. a moving van can be

jerry: may we help you...? 
bernard: sorry, i m a little early. i didn t realize today was moving day. 
jerry: should you have? 
beth: jerry, this is bernard shaw. he s my... friend. bernard, this is my... uh... 
jerry: husband. legally binding, in the eyes of the law and god. 
beth: soon to be divorced.-- 
jerry: allegedly! awkward silences all around. 
bernard: maybe i should come back? beth goes to bernard s side. 
beth: no, you re staying. bernard is my date. jerry... we are-- 
jerry: dating. no mansplaining needed. i take it those are a special tray of sex brownies you plan on defiling my wife with? 
bernard: well, first date and no-- 
jerry: forgive me for encroaching on the beginning of a very special time in both of your lives! i ll just load up my last box and, i don t know, pick up some loose, possibly drunk, cashier at the local hardees! say, bernard, have you met beth s father? 
bernard: i don t believe i--jerry laughs. 
jerry: adios! jerry walks out of the house and slams the door behind him.

jerry walks to the back of the moving truck, quietly crying. he puts the box in the back. 
[int. smith house - day] 
bernard and beth stand around, uncomfortable. 
bernard: (beat) so, that was... 
beth: awkward and embarrassing? i m asking, it s hard for me to tell anymore. bernard walks in front of beth, puts the tray down, and takes her hands. 
bernard: i ve been subjected to worse by more jealous husbands. hey, want a cookie? i baked them myself. bernard lifts a cookie and sensually feeds it to beth. 
beth: (mouth full) oh, wow, you bake. 
bernard: i bake love, beth. bernard rips the cookie, again sensually, slowly out of beth s mouth, leaving a bite for her. beth, looking into his eyes.

[ext. spidguin planet - day] 
rick and morty sprint up a hill and then quickly down it! behind them, hundreds of aliens who appear to be a hybrid of spiders and penguins. eight legs, penguin head, penguin tail instead of a spinner, and disgustingly adorable. 
[ext. spidguin planet - day] 
the entire hill is covered in very coarse looking, brown grass. rick turns around and shoots a freeze ray at 3 of the spidguins! they freeze into ice cubes and some of the other spidquins run into them and slide! 
rick: run faster, morty! we re almost to the planet s mainframe combobulator! a spidguin runs into one of it s brothers and they both collapse under the herd! 
morty: i m running as fast as i can, rick! this isn t your usual grassy terrain! it s prickly! wh... why s it so prickly?? 
rick: because you didn t stop talking about how heavy the stupid slightly heavier gravity was at the most opportune time to get noticed by an army of spidguins and now the universe has befitted that you get over that and bitch about the grass instead. i feel like we have this conversation, weekly. 
morty: i wasn t the one who brought us to a spider penguin planet in the first place, rick! you can t just--you can t just make me shoulder all the blame--rick 
different.  planet.  different. : grass. every week, morty! ya gotta trust me, we re burp we re slidin into home, morty. just one more stretch. bottom of the 9th... rick pulls out three illuminating spheres from his jacket. they approach the side of a mountain... with hair growing from it. rick throws the spheres at the wall. they splat and it eats a hole into the side. a screech makes the planet quake! the spidguins skid to a halt and run the other way. touchdown! 
morty: wha--what was that?? big! it sounded 
rick: calm your pre-pubescent tits, morty. ain t nothin that s got to do with us. that s for the spidguins to know and for us to ignore completely. 
morty: what did you throw at the wall? 
rick: you like that? i call them acid balloons! i couldn t find a rubber that could withstand hydrofluoric acid, so i did what any self respecting man would do, and reinvented rubber. 
morty: so, they re like, uh, water balloons? 
rick: yeah, they re like, uh , water balloons. except if you throw this at uh one of your friends burp one of your friends from school, you ll be tried for melting and murdering a uh child, consequently having to trade cigarettes for one less cuddle sesh with your cell mate gerald. he will not be gentle, morty. gerald is a hard man doing hard time. your nickname? time. come on. rick walks into the hole he created. 
morty: i gotta say, that sounded specific, rick... morty follows. 
[int. spidguin planet - day] 
the room is barren, outside of a nest of purple and green eggs that sit in the middle of it. 
morty: aw geez... who s eggs do you think those are? there s a lot of baby spider penguins sitting in that nest... 
rick: the queen! the biggest bitch in the entire galaxy. listen, this isn t the time for one of your cry baby morality filibusters that get us in a bind every week, morty. those babies belong to a mom, but probably not a dad, since spidguins are notorious for trampling the queen s mates to death after banging. best we make this quick. uh... good luck. rick takes a swig of his flask and puts it back in his jacket. morty frowns at rick. rick sigh. what now? 
morty: you didn t tell me we were here to kill a bunch of spider penguin babies. 
rick: spidguins, morty. what else did you think a mainframe combobulator was? a room full of pull switches, lights, and buttons? 
morty: that, more than baby eggs! 
rick: that s an interesting point, morty. but wholly stupid for reasons i can t go into right now, because the queen is right on top of us! morty looks up and rick pushes morty into the nest! ha haaa, a sucker s born every minute, morty! smash the eggs! green, purple, purple, green! gotta do it in that order, morty! you gotta do it! if you mess up, if you mess the whole thing up, then we re gonna be in a whole heap of trouble, morty! maybe if you do it right, we ll go to the quagalon server 5 quadrant. their rivers run with alcoholic chocolate milk. alcoholic chocolate milk, morty! 
morty: i don t drink! 
rick: you could start. what are you, 12? 13? the spidguin queen falls from the ceiling behind rick! rick turns around and runs to morty! quick, morty! smash the eggs! it's the only way to destroy the  planet! (the queen screeches) 
morty: ohhhhhh geeeeeeeeez! morty closes his eyes and picks up a green egg-- green! smash! sorry! purple! picks up a purple egg--smash! sorry! green--! rick throws the rest of his acid balloons at the queen as it sprints at him! he s running backwards! purple! 
rick: purple! 
morty: purple! morty picks up a purple egg--smash! sorry! green! the queen looks to morty and screeches! the ground and runs towards morty--she hits rick to morty picks up the green egg--smash! the queen stops... she lifts her head and squeaks different tones. 
rick: oh boy, ya better get outta that nest, morty! she called the family down for dinner! the planet quakes uncontrollably! nest and hides behind rick. morty jumps out of the out of tunnels above, spidguins file out onto the ground! dozens! rick pulls out his teleportation gun. my name is rick sanchez, spidguin race. say hello to your extinction. rick points the gun at the wall and shoots! or whatever.

rick and morty crash to the ground in the garage! 
morty: geez, rick! why did we even go to that planet if we were just gonna blow it up!? all of those spidguins! dead! because of us! 
rick: you just answered your dumb question with a dumb, but accurate answer, morty. quick, morty! were we the only ones who made it out?? rick and morty both get up. 
morty: i-i-i-i think so... 
rick: oh-ho, you think so! well, keep your eyes peeled, morty. if even one, just one, of those spidguins came through the teleportation portal, we re riggidy riggidy fucked, morty! so think! 
morty: i m pretty sure we were alone-- 
rick: because that last planet we were on, alpha zeb cervos? yeah, you may know it as it s alternate dimension doppelgänger mars . that s what they do! they--they get inside your planet and they make it one of them! just one of those--one of those things can turn all of earth into a fish guzzling nightmare, morty! all it wants is to bang, eat fish, and trample men to death! i don t know about you morty-- 
morty: i don t see it around, rick! think we re in the clear--i 
rick: but that s not a world i want to live in--squeak! a spidguin sprints down the driveway! 
morty: it s getting away! 
rick: wait for it. 
morty: sh-sh-shoot it, rick! i don t want earth to be a sex slave fish market! 
rick: i said wait for it, morty. like in those terrible action movies your dad loves. 
morty: if i m being honest, i d rather not talk about dad right now--the spidguin runs into the street-- 
rick: cold blooded, biiiiiiiiitch! rick pulls out his freeze ray and turns the spidguin into a block of ice! 
morty: was the waiting necessary?? 
rick: you like the rick james reference?--a car smashes into the ice cube and ice ice covered spidguin bits roll all around the road! the car comes to a screeching stop! 
rick: maybe he s before your time. summer gets out of the car. 
summer: what the hell, grandpa! 
rick: perfect as usual, summer! rick walks away, throws the freeze ray behind him for morty to catch. morty juggles it and catches it. 
rick: good catch, morty. rick s off screen. door open. 
rick: you don t wanna know what happens when that thing breaks. 
close. : morty goes into a rage and slams the gun against everything in the garage! it doesn t even scratch. he huffs and puffs. he then puts the freeze ray on the work bench and rests his forehead on it. summer parks in the drive way and gets out of the car. she walks into the garage. 
summer: off on another summerless adventure? 
morty: just came back from exterminating an entire alien species... 
summer: you don t have to rub it in... is mom s date here yet? is he hot? she says he s hot. morty lifts his head and turns to summer. 
morty: her what? 
summer: ohhh, you re not still hung up on dad leaving us, are you?--morty runs into the house!

morty: of course i haven t met bernard! he s your date--you re dating him--you re dating?! 
bernard: we re dating! hi, morty. i ve heard a lot about you. heck, i ve heard a lot about the lot of you! it s been a very informative afternoon. i feel... oh, i dunno... a real closeness with all of you already. 
rick: ha-ha, same here, berning man! listen, morty, why don t you grab a chair. bernard was just in the middle of telling us a funny story about why his name is bernard. summer walks into the dining room. amused by what s going on. morty looks less than 
summer: oh, i didn t know we had guests. 
morty: his name s bernard, he s dating our yet to be divorced mother now, claims to be funny soon... morty sits down, not taking his eyes off bernard. 
summer: cool cooooool--are those cookies? summer refers to the cookie tray full of cookies in the middle of the table. 
bernard: sure are, honey. made specially for each and every one of you. eat as many as you want! your grandpa s already stuffed down 3! 
rick: i can t help it, i d think they were baked with love or something, if i didn t know love was just an idiotic mating chemical. beth, i know you just recently finally came to your senses and kicked out that dead weight jerry, but i like this one. he bakes cookies and doesn t make me regret your birth. 
beth: aww, dad... beth reaches across the table and grabs rick s hand. they look at each other, lovingly. beth retracts it and returns it to bernard s hand. summer sits down at the table and takes a cookie. takes a bite. she 
summer: oh my god, i think my mouth just got pregnant... 
bernard: come on, morty. why don t you have a cookie? 
morty: i think i ll keep my mouth a virgin, thank you. why don t you continue your funny story about your name being bernard. rick laughs. 
rick: yes, please. rick picks up a cookie and morty slaps his hand. drops the cookie by force. rick he pretends he s eating a cookie anyway. morty looks around the table at everyone looking at bernard, moon-eyed. 
bernard: well, the long story is the short story. i was born november 3rd, 1981. which, if you were to place the year the great scientist who played a vital role in laying down the basic rules of experimentation in the life sciences, particularly with the liver and pancreas, claude bernard who was born in 1813 in a different numerical order, you d come up with 11 3 81. the whole table laughs, except for morty. 
morty: that s not funny! that s just garbled gobbity... b. s.! beth slams her hand on the table, angry! 
beth: morty! 
rick: don t mind the boy, bernard. he s just the hired help when i go on space explorations and dimension hop and shit. 
bernard: space explorations? outer space? i heard you re an accomplished scientist, but i didn t realize to what extent... 
rick: what, you wanna take a spin on an adventure? huh? go to a spider clownfish planet? huh? 
morty: no!!! no more spider hybrids! it s lazy! 
rick: ignore morty, he s barely a person. come on, we ll make it a family outing! 
morty: he s not family! are all of you high?--did bernard get you all high?? bernard laughs heartily. 
bernard: i wasn t told the house was green friendly, morty, so no, i haven t gotten any of you high. 
summer: mom, morty s being rude to new dad and making him feel unwelcome! 
beth: morty, if your grandfather wants to invite us all on a space adventure as a family, i don t see how you have any say in the matter! 
rick: yeah burp bitch. bernard belches. rick laughs. 
rick: classic bernard. then it s settled! pack nothing and get your asses to the garage! the sanchez shaw vacation is a go! morty slinks his head in disgust. end of act 2act 3 
[int. morty’s room - night] 
rick slams the door behind morty and himself. to morty’s book case and scrolls the books. rick goes 
morty: what are you doing, rick? 
rick: getting prepared to kill your dad, morty. rick pulls out a journal book and flips to a specific page that has dozens of combinations written in. like a table chart. 
morty: oh... wait--kill my dad?? why!? 
rick: stop asking questions with an infinite number of answers, morty. we don t have much time. rick writes in the book, with the pencil inside, 2 all of morty s things in his room flip upside down and weapons and gear pop up. 
morty: what the hell is this?? has this been here the whole time you ve lived here?? 
rick: pretty much. rick grabs a laser beam shotgun. he cocks it back, one handed, and it makes a beam charging up sound. 
rick: i hid it here incase one of our parallel selves tried to infest our dimension. well, today s the day, morty. bernard is an evil jerry who plans on killing all of us or getting revenge on us in some predictably jerry fashion. 
morty: shouldn t you be more specific?? how do we know that s him? oh man, now i know why everything falls out of my drawers! i hate you-- 
rick: those cookies? 
morty: yeah? 
rick: roofie cookies, morty. your own mother and sister would have given in to a three way with your parallel father, if given the right fucked up jerry. 
morty: gross, shut up! rick throws the shotgun to morty and rick picks up a green laser pistol. 
rick: i created an immunity to roofalin years ago, so i played along after i saw how obsessed your mom was with that obvious jerry job. 
morty: i didn t think he was like dad! he doesn t even look like him... 
rick: some jerry s would have access to the best plastic surgeons in the universe. just--just think about it, morty. he tells stories just like jerry. badly. he tries way too hard to be a part of the family. he wears old spice, morty. only jerry and other pathetic middle aged sex offenders wear old spice. come on, let s lead him to a scorpider planet and watch mother nature take it s course. rick walks towards the door. 
morty: wait a minute! morty stands in front of rick. 
morty: so you re telling me mom fell in love with dad twice? 
rick: how do you think i feel, morty? for 17 years, i hoped your mother would leave your piece of shit dad and get herself a man who didn t reek of desperation and the constant pathetic need to be accepted. but here we are. new guy, same sitting down to pee douchebag. morty takes a beat to process what needs to happen... he opens the bedroom door and--bernard is standing in the doorway. 
morty: hey... uh... bernard... 
bernard: what are you two off doing before adventure time? you said it yourself, rick. pack nothing. get our asses to the garage , to paraphrase. you two wouldn t be having... secret conversations behind the family s back? perish the thought, right? not when we were all getting along so well! together... 
morty: hahaa, what do ya mean bernster?? that s crazy! that s crazy talk right there! what could rick and i possibly have to say to each other--rick points his laser gun at bernard. beep beep boop charge up sounds. it makes laser gun 
rick: much like the fate of all useless dances, the jig is up, morty. except this time, it ends with the sound of your parallel universe dad s brains becoming the new house paint. so. 
bernard: you know i m a jerry. 
rick: no, i know you re an evil jerry, which makes you about 25 cooler than most other jerry s but still pretty much a lame waste of dna that i have to get rid of systematically. again. morty lifts his shotgun and points it at bernard. 
bernard: how d you figure it out? 
rick: well, the trace elements of date rape in the cookies was a pretty clear red flag. seriously, our jerry is useless, but at least he wouldn t stoop so low as to drug his family for acceptance. bernard smiles and laughs evily. as he does. 
bernard: you are very ignorant of us jerrys, rick sanchez. you always have been and you always will be. but you see, we aren t as transparent as you rick s would have most to believe. bernard pushes on his wrist watch and-- 
(the entire house melts away and they sit in the cave of a spidguin queen)
[int. spidguin queen’s cave - night] 
beth and summer are hanging on a big web against the wall! 
beth: bernard! i really think we should see other people! 
summer: maybe he s kidnapped us for our own good, mom. don t dismiss new dad like that. 
morty: he s not our new dad, summer! he s old dad, but from a dimension where dad is evil and has expensive plastic surgeon friends! he drugged you all with roofalin! 
summer: roo-fa-lin? summer laughs so hard. she can t stop. 
beth: jerry did that? bernard walks forward. 
bernard: no, wife. bernard done that! i stripped my jerry persona long ago! the same day these two bernardict arnolds killed my family... us? beth 
shut up,  summer. : summer s still laughing. 
bernard: no, beth. after we got divorced, i aligned myself with the spidguins and have done their will and bidding for years. in my dimension, you get cancer and die. i gave you the cancer, but the details are meaningless. bernard turns to rick. 
bernard: you like your new home, rick and morty? please, make yourselves presentable to eat. spidguins crawl towards rick and morty, steal their guns, and other spidguins pick them up and throw them against the web. 
rick: you did something to my portal gun. 
bernard: merely changed it s coordinates to arrive at the same planet in a different time and dimension, where i had a hologram room set up that replicated all of your little toys. learned those fun tricks from rick 1173 and 4254... made sure to wait, of course, until we were fully stocked with hungry spidguin babies and one horny mother--the spidguin queen falls dead from above and crashes onto the ground, bleeding green blood. everyone looks up. it s jerry! he s in a mech! 
jerry: i m sorry, me. but it looks like mom is dead. jerry! 
beth: you came for us! jerry tries to jump down to where they are, but falls off balance, and crashes to the ground. summer 
roof? : alin! 
beth: jerry... you came for us... bernard picks jerry up out of the mech and in front of his face. 
jerry: (beat) perhaps i was a tad insensitive after killing your adoptive mother? 
bernard: i would have done the same thing. you were in the heat of the moment! right? 
jerry: i was pretty cool! 
bernard: i admit, it was a great entrance. i will of course kill you for killing the queen-- 
jerry: who could blame you!-- 
rick: quick, jerry, before you both start masturbating each other! kick the arm of the mech towards the web! jerry swings his legs and kicks the arm! 
bernard: what are you doing?? 
rick: being the rickiest rick you ve ever fucked wit , bernard! that s a dumb name, by the way, and i think your stories are dull as shit. rick taps his shoes in a rhythm. his shoes light up and the mech s arm sprays fire all over the web which catches fire to the entire web infested cave. the family find themselves free! summer looks dazed. 
summer: where am i? 
beth: back from hopefully the last time you ever get date rape drugged, sweetheart... beth and summer hug. 
summer: what? oh... summer turns to bernard. 
summer: gross! rick picks up his laser gun. bernard throws jerry aside. beep beep boop! beth runs to his side. bernard walks towards rick. 
bernard: and what do you suppose you re going to do with that, rick? kill me? i m afraid you re running out of time. you see, my babies are coming--rick shoots the eggs in the middle of the nest that sits in the center of the cave in the order morty smashed them before, just as morty blasts bernard in the back with the laser shotgun! 
morty: i hate it when they monologue. if you re going to be evil, just be evil! ya know? you re just dragging it out like you re some sort of sick idiot criminal who wants to get caught. it s like, you re just asking for something bad to happen--the planet starts shaking--squeeeeeek!!! 
rick: morty jinxed the adventure! to go home! time rick pulls out his teleportation gun and changes the settings. he points the gun at the wall and they all jump through it--dozens of spidguins race down to the center of the cave! they notice their dead mother... they look up-- 
[ext. space - space time] 
the spidguin planet screams and explodes into... marshmallow peeps! a space craft slowly flies into frame towards the debris-- 
[int. smith house garage - day] 
everyone falls out of the portal. the portal closes. everyone looks around, awkward. 
jerry: well... i ll see you guys later. off to the new bachelor pad! you guys should come by sometime. it d be nice to... anyway, i ll see ya--beth moves forward. 
beth: jerry... jerry turns around. rick slinks his head and shakes it. 
beth: maybe you should stay. yeah, dad! 
morty: move back in! jerry smiles, tears in his eyes. he turns around and walks out of the house. 
slam. : beth crosses her arms. she walks into the kitchen. the living room. her crying can be heard in a spidguin sneaks across the floor. the face with the laser shotgun. morty shoots it inend of act 3post credits 
[int. smith house living room - night] 
close up: the television turns to a channel. a commercial plays! it s in the fashion of a sardella s pizza and wings commercial you might see from the 90 s. 
announcer: marzella s, babies and things! only marzella s has my favorite eats! a martian couple are eating pizza with baby faces on it as toppings. 
martian man: you can t believe how hard it is to find fresh baby human on our planet. marzella s is the only place that has my favorite eats! they both eat the pieces of pizza, savagely. 
announcer: marzellas! 
(the tv gets shut off. sitting on the couch. rick turns to morty.) 
morty: did dad ever tell anyone the address to his new place? he just kept referring to it as his bachelor pad . ya know, i really don t like how fast mom and dad are moving on from each other. sure, bernard was my dad but not my dad, but, ya know--take some time for self-reflection, ya know? work on you for a few months. 
rick: self-reflection is for college dropouts and people who prefer laugh tracks, morty. the most soulless humans on the planet. perfect for jerry. your mom? not so much. besides, the only women jerry is going to be bringing home are hardee s cashiers on their graveyard shift just before they crack a xanex and veg out . rick takes a swig of his flask. morty looks at rick, unhappy. morty walks away from the couch. rick turns on the tv. cut to 
[ext. hardee’s parking lot - night] 
jerry whistles as he walks to the sidewalk, next to hardee’s. he’s carrying a plastic bag with something in it. he walks to a cardboard box that has a cut out hole on the side and stops. 10 other boxes surround it. these would be his belongings. oh, honey. 
jerry: i m home. he pulls out a fluffy dog bed out of the bag, puts it under the cut out box, and lays in it. yup. 
jerry: home sweet home... crack of thunder! (it begins to rain. hard.)

(morty wearing white medical mask, blue latex gloves and carrying a briefcase going from door to door trying to save earth from space aids that rick infected the planet with after their latest adventure to galactaleon.) 
(morty knocks on door of suburban house. door opens and space aids victim [lots of puss] emerges.) 
morty: hello sir! i m here on the behalf of dimensional absolution rehabilitation corp.) 
morty: (holds up picture of rick holding a baby alien in what appears to be a war torn village) dimensional absolution rehabilitation corp is the finest dimension restoration company in the multiverse. today we are offering you compensation for your planets outbreak of space aids by choosing another lifeform to transfer your mind into. the procedure is like totally safe and painless and has been used to fix dimensions plagued by other biological issues rick caused. would you be interested in pursuing life free of space aids today? 
space   aids   victim: urrrrrrrrrrggggggh . 
morty: is that a yes sir?! i just need you to initial some paperwork for me. and we can get you on the path to a life free of suffering!

morty: [tired] hi morty. this is morty c-121 requesting immediate rick presence at location a-56653. can he bring me a towel also? 
morty   dispatcher: rick b-156 has been dispatched and is portaling to your location now. he said he forgot the towel before he left. sorry morty c-1

rick   b-156: what the hell morty? the fuck did the whale come from? 
morty: but rick he was- 
rick   b-156: shut your crap hole morty. you know that whales are a class -m conversion species. you know what that means dumpster skull? 
morty: rick he tri- 
rick   b-156: yeah i know morty he tried real hard to find a new life as a space aids free giant [belches] swimming lump of flammable fat. the japanese government paid us a lot of money to convert their prisoners [belches] into class -m species. i m going to cover this one time for you since you're new. that s your one free rick covers my butt for the billionth time card right out the window. there it goes morty. gone with the schwin. 
morty: oh geez rick! 
(rick​ ​b-156​ ​shoots​ ​portal​ ​gun​ ​at​ ​whale​ ​who​ ​disappears​ ​in​ ​a​ ​flash​ ​of​ ​green light​.) 
morty: i think he was a sex offender of some sort rick. he tried to shove his fingers down my pants. 
rick: again morty[belches] trying to cover up for all the morty shortcomings with excuses. stop milking the bull crap and pull up your pants and help me with the next assignment. i m supposed to be bringing in some low-level space aids sleazeball who skipped out on meeting with parole rick last week. we just need to grab the guy and we can get the hell out of here so i can take a shit. 
(rick​ ​fires​ ​portal​ ​gun​ ​at​ ​a​ ​wall.​ ​rick​ ​and​ ​morty​ ​walk​ ​through​ ​portal.​ ​portal appears​ ​on​ ​the​ ​opposite​ ​wall​ ​of​ ​the​ ​room​ ​where​ ​the​ ​same​ ​rick​ ​and​ ​morty​ ​appear.) 
rick:[speaking softly] morty. this wouldn t happen to be location a-56653 would it? 
morty: oh geez rick. that s kinda right here. 
(rick​ ​pulls​ ​out​ ​his​ ​phone​ ​and​ ​dials) 
morty   dispatcher: this is d. a. r. c emergency hotline, morty c-201 speaking. how may i direct your call? 
rick: shut up morty. i wouldn t call this [belches] number unless i expected to reach the hotline. i m gonna need a full profile on- (pauses and looks at morty) who was the guy you just turned into a freaking whale morty? 
morty: ummm i think his name was berggie klapptors. 
rick: information on a bergoogie [belches] klapptors. 
morty   dispatcher: i m sending you the information now rick. 
(small​ ​green​ ​portal​ ​opens​ ​up​ ​above​ ​morty’s​ ​head.​ ​a​ ​tube​ ​with​ ​paper​ ​in​ ​it​ ​falls out​ ​of​ ​it​ ​hitting​ ​him​ ​on​ ​the​ ​head.) 
morty: ow! 
rick: shut up and grab the paper morty. 
morty   dispatcher: wishing you and morty the best of lu- 
(rick​ ​hangs​ ​up​ ​the​ ​phone​ ​and​ ​snatches​ ​the​ ​tube.​ ​removing​ ​the​ ​paper​ ​and beginning​ ​to​ ​read.) 
rick: oh man morty this is worse than i thought. (reading paper from tube) 
morty: what is it rick? is he some type of evil genius or serial rapist or freak or something? 
rick: i think those bobbish nachos i ate on my way to the office are really screwing with my stomach. i gotta go take a morty [chuckles]. think this guy's got a shitter or something in this place. 
(rick​ ​walks​ ​to​ ​a​ ​door​ ​and​ ​opens​ ​it​ ​revealing​ ​a​ ​bathroom.​ ​several​ ​young​ ​boys​ ​run out​ ​of​ ​the​ ​room​ ​and​ ​disappear​ ​outside.) 
young   boys: [unison] we are free! 
(rick​ ​goes​ ​into​ ​bathroom​ ​for​ ​10​ ​seconds​ ​and​ ​emerges​ ​fanning​ ​the​ ​air​ ​while laughing.) 
rick: oh man morty i think one of those kids died in their. will you take a look and snap some pictures for evidence. 
morty: oh man rick. i don t know. 
(morty​ ​walks​ ​into​ ​bathroom.​ ​rick​ ​slams​ ​door​ ​and​ ​leans​ ​against​ ​it​ ​keeping​ ​morty from​ ​opening​ ​it.​ ​gagging​ ​can​ ​be​ ​heard​ ​from​ ​inside.) 
rick: [laughing] he was alive before i took that shit. too bad the only candle this guy owned smells like used underwear and chloroform. 
(morty​ ​repeatedly​ ​slams​ ​himself​ ​against​ ​door​ ​[out​ ​of​ ​view].​ ​rick​ ​is​ ​leaning against​ ​the​ ​door​ ​and​ ​pulls​ ​out​ ​the​ ​paper​ ​that​ ​was​ ​delivered​ ​and​ ​begins​ ​to​ ​read it.) 
rick: [muttering] three cases of interdimensional sodomy (morty continues to slam against door) potential suspect in the deaths of morty d-112, b-175, c-333 and d-541 
(door​ ​begins​ ​to​ ​crack​ ​from​ ​morty​ ​repeatedly​ ​throwing​ ​himself​ ​against​ ​it) 
morty: [labored breathing] aww man, c-333 is dead? we went through d. a. r. c training together. that morty was super chill, he d literally do anything for a piece of taffy. 
rick: oh shit morty this guy is way worse than i thought we gotta go right freaking [belches] now. 
(rick​ ​moves​ ​to​ ​side.​ ​morty​ ​comes​ ​flying​ ​through​ ​door​ ​into​ ​a​ ​pile​ ​of​ ​pus​ ​on​ ​the floor. all​ ​the​ ​space​ ​aids​ ​victims​ ​get​ ​sent​ ​out​ ​to​ ​the​ ​rick​ ​dump​ ​on​ ​uranus​) 
rick: [chuckles] let's go to this shithole! 
(shoots​ ​portal​ ​gun​ ​against​ ​wall.​ ​rick​ ​runs​ ​through​ ​first​ ​followed​ ​by​ ​morty​ ​who slips​ ​on​ ​the​ ​puss​ ​covered​ ​floor​ ​falling​ ​head​ ​over​ ​heels​ ​into​ ​the​ ​portal.) 
[planet​ ​of​ ​ uranus​ ​- brown​ ​and​ ​yellow​ ​surface​ ​-​ ​beach]

rick: well morty welcome to uranus. (pulls out a mask and hands it to morty) the literal sewer hole of the universe. every transphoton toilet and phashitter in the dimension [belches] runs straight here. the only thing redeeming about the entire place is rick s sending chunky mortys to lose weight from all the trichinosis (gestures to a group of fat morty s trying to shit out a giant worm while a rick wearing athletic wear observes.) 
[planet​ ​of​ uranus​ - ​harbor]

morty: uhh gee rick why is everyone working here my dad? 
rick: [belches] these are all the jerrys who killed their rick at some point. rick s never saw earth prison as being enough so they sent them here. to live in a perpetual world of shit until they die from a crapalanche or kill themselves [belches]. 
(in​ ​the​ ​distance​ ​a​ ​mountain​ ​crumbles.​ ​distant​ ​jerry​ ​screaming​ ​can​ ​be​ ​heard.) 
morty: [angrily] is this where we send all of the space aids victims from that planet? to a stinking pile of shit? i thought d. a. r. c was trying to make things right in all the dimensions rick screwed up. 
rick: [laughs] you thought you signed up to do some sort of humanitarian save the planet blah blah blah mission. typical morty never seeing the big picture. when a rick screws up a dimension it becomes crap. where do you think all the crap goes? (gestures with arms indicating this place) once we have the planet clear we send in salvage morty s to strip out anything of value and sell it for cheap at schmekel rick s. (flashes to morty s working in a dollar store . aliens pick through piles of people s goods and possessions.) the rest of the planet gets smelted down and turned into weapons that d. a. r. c. sells to gorilla armies [belches] where did you think your salary came from? just magically appeared for taking the moral high ground? (flashes to gorillas with ak-47 s raiding a village of humans. laughing rick s can be seen flying away in d. a. r. c ships with overflowing bags of schmeckles.) 
(morty​ ​approaches​ ​a​ ​beggar​ ​jerry​ ​wrapped​ ​in​ ​a​ ​cloak​ ​of​ ​toilet​ ​paper.) 
jerry: [feebly] spare a schmeckel for your dad? 
morty: erhm i guess just one (reaches for backpocket for wallet) 
rick: screw you jerry. you walked away from your family and tried to solve it by axing a rick. you couldn t see the big picture. no matter how many rick s you kill off they will always find you. you re just another pathetic mud crab who lives on a cosmic sewer plant. (pulls out pistol and shoots the jerry between the eyes.) 
morty: what the hell rick? (morty stands up wiping jerry blood off of his arm) 
rick: i did him a favor [belches] morty. look around morty. he s making toilet wine with literal piss and smoking fossilized piles of shit to somehow make speed up the process of all the methane melting his brain down into a pile of shit flecked snot. 
(jerry​ ​moans​ ​and​ ​shifts​ ​on​ ​the​ ​ground.​ ​rick​ ​shoots​ ​him​ ​again​ ​stopping​ ​the moaning.​ ​morty​ ​looks​ ​traumatized​ ​and​ ​tired.) 
[planet​ ​of uranus​ ​-​ ​ocean​ ​of​ ​uranus] 
(rick​ ​and​ ​morty​ ​sit​ ​in​ ​a​ ​row​ ​boat.​ ​rick​ ​is​ ​relaxing​ ​near​ ​the​ ​bow​ ​drinking​ ​from his​ ​flask.​ ​rick​ ​cradles​ ​a ​giant​ ​harpoon​ ​in​ ​his​ ​free​ ​hand. ​rick​ ​wears​ ​a​ ​pirate hat.​ ​morty​ ​is​ ​sweating​ ​as​ ​he​ ​rows​ ​the​ ​boat​ ​out​ ​to​ ​sea.​ ​morty​ ​wears​ ​a​ ​white sailor​ ​outfit.) 
rick: [belches] keep an eye out morty. that damn whale could pop up at any moment. 
(rick​ ​pulls​ ​out​ ​a​ ​spyglass​ ​and​ ​scans​ ​the​ ​horizon.​ ​moving​ ​back​ ​and​ ​forth​ ​until​ ​a mist​ ​of​ ​brown​ ​water​ ​appears​ ​out​ ​in​ ​the​ ​distance.) 
rick: row morty! the whale. he be swimming to the portside 
morty: why are you talking like a pirate rick 
rick: i don t know. figured it would help give rick and morty a more diverse culture. plus i ve always wanted to bust out this bad boy (rick motions towards harpoon.) 
morty: can t you make something to move the boat faster rick? like an engine or mechanical robot or something? (sweating hard looking tired .) 
rick: i can do better than that morty! 
(rick​ ​produces​ ​a​ ​conch​ ​shell​ ​from​ ​his​ ​lab​ ​coat.​ ​he​ ​stands​ ​on​ ​the​ ​bow​ ​and​ ​blows it​ ​hard.​ ​the​ ​water​ ​around​ ​the​ ​boat​ ​begins​ ​to​ ​swirl.​ ​the​ ​boat​ ​is​ ​surrounded​ ​by a​ ​massive​ ​swarm​ ​of​ ​dolphin​ ​jerry’s.) 
morty: rick? why are there hundreds of dolphins that look like my dad swimming around the boat? 
(rick​ ​begins​ ​to​ ​tie​ ​ropes​ ​around​ ​the​ ​jerry​ ​dolphins) 
rick: infinite dimensions morty. human jerry isn t the only jerry that gets banished to this planet for killing their ricks. all the creatures here are jerry s of some sorts. (throws morty the spyglass. morty holds it and peers at a school of fish swimming beneath the boat. they all have jerry s face.) turn the knob on the right of the scope thing morty. 
(morty​ ​turns​ ​the​ ​dial​ ​and​ ​looks​ ​at​ ​the​ ​water.​ ​now​ ​he​ ​can​ ​see​ ​the​ ​cells​ ​on​ ​the surface​ ​are​ ​made​ ​of​ ​tiny​ ​jerry’s​ ​swimming​ ​around​ ​bumping​ ​into​ ​one​ ​another. ​he looks​ ​amazed.) 
morty: aw jeez rick, i don t think my dad s a bad guy on the cellular level. 
rick: maybe not the one you know, but if you're jerry ever screws me over i ll send him back to live in a world made of shit, in a city made of shit, in a house made of shit, [cackles madly]. 
morty: rick i get it, my dad's a shitty person. can we focus on catching this pedophile whale so i can go home? 
rick: sure morty, just wait until you see planet of morty s that killed off their ricks. 
morty: wait there s a planet like this for mortys? 
rick: classified[belches]. i ve said too much already. 
(rick​ ​flicks​ ​the​ ​rope​ ​connected​ ​to​ ​the​ ​jerry​ ​dolphins.​ ​knocking​ ​morty​ ​backwards off​ ​his​ ​seat.​ ​the​ ​boat​ ​speeds​ ​across​ ​the​ ​water.​ ​the​ ​whale​ ​breaches​ ​in​ ​the distance.) 
rick:[shouting over the roar of the wind] morty. i need you to come up here and man the harpoon. 
(morty​ ​stands​ ​up,​ ​off​ ​balance​ ​and​ ​moves​ ​towards​ ​the​ ​bow​ ​of​ ​the​ ​boat.​ ​rick flicks​ ​the​ ​reins​ ​and​ ​the​ ​boat​ ​comes​ ​to​ ​an​ ​abrupt​ ​halt.​ ​morty​ ​is​ ​launched through​ ​the​ ​air​ ​and​ ​flies​ ​into​ ​the​ ​ocean.​ ​he​ ​surfaces​ spouting​ ​out​ ​some​ ​brown water.) 
morty: [sputtering] what the hell rick? 
(rick​ ​stands​ ​at​ ​the​ ​bow​ ​steadying​ ​the​ ​harpoon​ ​rifle​ ​aiming​ ​in​ ​morty’s direction.) 
rick: how did you think we were going to catch a pedophile whale morty? with candy or the vague promise of a pony ride in a van with no windows? 
morty: geez rick can t we use something that doesn t involve a giant whale trying to molest me? 
rick: maybe thrash around a bit more morty. i don t think you're arousing his interest. (drinks from flask. he sways steadying himself.) 
morty: can you put down the booze rick? your pointing a harpoon gun right at me! 
rick: [belches] just relax morty. i ll all be ok. 
morty: i think something just touched my leg ri- 
(morty​ ​is​ ​pulled​ ​underneath​ ​the​ ​surface​ ​of​ ​the​ ​ocean.​ ​a​ ​giant​ ​white​ ​whale breaches​ ​with​ ​morty​ ​in​ ​his​ ​mouth.) 
morty:[screaming] rick help! 
rick: hold still morty i m trying to get a shot! 
(rick​ ​shoots​ ​the​ ​harpoon​ ​striking​ ​the​ ​whale​ ​on​ ​the​ ​side.​ ​the​ ​whale​ ​lets​ ​go​ ​of morty​ ​who​ ​flies​ ​out​ ​of​ ​the​ ​whale's​ ​mouth​ ​into​ ​the​ ​boat.​ ​launching​ ​rick​ ​into the​ ​air.) 
rick: [yells] press the red button on the harpoon morty! quick! 
(morty​ ​runs​ ​to​ ​the​ ​harpoon​ ​which​ ​is​ ​quickly​ ​unspooling​ ​rope​ ​and​ ​presses​ ​a​ ​large red​ ​button.​ ​the​ ​whale​ ​explodes​ ​sending​ ​chunks​ ​of​ ​blubber​ ​and​ ​gore​ ​flying.​ ​rick and​ ​morty​ ​are​ ​both​ ​drenched​ ​in​ ​the​ ​whale​ ​blood.​ ​both​ ​sit​ ​down​ ​into​ ​the​ ​boat wearily.) 
rick: that puts the blow in blowhole huh morty? 
morty: can we just go home rick? 
rick: sure morty, but first one stop (shoots portal gun into water) 
[new​ ​japan - sushi​ ​bar] 
(rick​ ​and​ ​morty​ ​sit​ ​in​ ​an​ ​alien​ ​sushi​ ​restaurant. the​ ​worker​ ​behind​ ​the​ ​bar​ ​is a​ ​crazy​ ​looking​ ​alien. ​in​ ​front​ ​of​ ​them​ ​is​ ​a​ ​massive​ ​mountain​ ​of​ ​assorted alien​ ​sushi.) 
rick: turns out pedophile whale [belches] is way more valuable to these guys than i thought. something about the flavor being youthful. might have to start hunting down more creeps to haul in the schmeckles. 
morty: i don t think this fish is making me feel very good rick. 
rick: figures since that s one of the jerry pufferfishes i brought back from uranus. probably don t want to eat too much of that. 
(morty​ ​passes​ ​out​ ​at​ ​the​ ​table​ ​into​ ​his​ ​plate.) 
rick: that s the end of season 3 ladies and gentlemen! thats right we closed it without any cliffhangers, unsolved mysteries, or ominous foreshadowing of a new villain! just a good old rick and morty [belches] adventure. peace. (throws peaces sign and jumps through portal. the alien sushi chef strokes morty s hair and then drags him into the backroom.) 
[suburban​ ​house] 
(morty​ ​is​ ​sitting​ ​at​ ​a​ ​table.​ ​a​ ​plate​ ​of​ ​cookies​ ​is​ ​set​ ​out​ ​before​ ​him. ​a perverted​ ​alien​ pedophile​​ ​walks​ ​through​ ​the​ ​front​ ​door.) 
alien   pedophile: hi little guy, just figured i d drop by so we could become friends! i brought you some watermelon sniggleberry shandy! 
morty: uhhh oh jeez hi. i m gonna, uh be right back, to uh grab some uh underwear. 
alien   pedophile: take your time sweetie. i ll be right here. 
(rick​ ​walks​ ​through​ ​the​ ​door​ ​in​ ​a​ ​suit​ ​and​ ​tie​ ​carrying​ ​a​ ​clipboard.) 
rick: hello there. 
alien   pedophile: [nervously] hi, are you his father? 
rick: not exactly, why don t you take a seat right over there. 
(the​ ​two​ ​sit​ ​down​ ​at​ ​the​ ​table.​ ​the​ ​alien​ ​pedophile​ ​eats​ ​some​ ​of​ ​the​ ​cookies.) 
rick: what was your plan here today with morty?, erm, let's see your online chat name was, ispl00ge4m0rty? 
alien   pedophile: urp well i was just looking for a friend. morty seemed like a really cool guy! 
rick: and how old did morty say he was on the internet? 
alien   pedophile: errrmm i think he said 
(rick​ ​holds​ ​up​ ​the​ ​clipboard) 
rick: you know i have the entire transcript of your chat logs right here dumbass? i m going to save you myself some effort and not draw this out. go home and think about why this is wrong and how you won t ever do it again. i bet you had a long drive here won t have a cookie before you go? they re fresh baked. 
alien   pedophile: [nervous laughter] well alright thanks mister! 
(the​ ​alien​ ​pedophile​ ​takes​ ​a​ ​bite​ ​of​ ​the​ ​cookie.​ ​a​ ​flash​ ​of​ ​light​ ​pulses through​ ​the​ ​room​ ​and​ ​a​ ​giant​ ​whale​ ​is​ ​left​ ​laying​ ​in​ ​his​ ​place.​ ​rick​ ​pulls​ ​out a​ ​cell​ ​phone​ ​and​ ​dials.) 
rick: [speaking in japanese] ohayoo, tsujiku-san i have another especial pedowhaleru [belches] for you to come buy. [pauses] 300 schmeckles, no no no i can t go lower than that.[pauses] i m hanging up now. goodbye [pauses] alright good i ll take 300 schemckles. pleasure doing business. (hangs up phone. rick shoots whale with portal gun in its place a bag of schmeckles is left behind.) 
summer smith lays in bed, sleeping. a chime sounds on her phone. she yawns, sits up, and grabs it. a cheesy 8-bit style animation with balloons, a birthday cake, and celebratory 8-bit music displays. “happy birthday!” summer smiles, dismissing the notification. 
[int. smith home - kitchen - day] 
jerry stands at the counter, icing a cake. summer walks in, a smile on her face as she grabs milk from the fridge. she sees jerry while pouring a glass. 
summer: aw, you didn t have to! 
jerry: oh, i know, but it seemed so wrong not to celebrate. 
summer: i appreciate it, dad. 
jerry: (pleasantly surprised) i m glad you do. sometimes i feel like i m the only person in this family who celebrates the things that truly matter. 
summer: that s so sweet! summer approaches him. she sees the cake he is icing. on the magnificently decorated cake, it reads, happy arbor day! arbor day, really? 
jerry: (unsure) yes? that s exactly how your mom reacted. huh. 
summer: and you didn t think, maybe there s something else about today that s, truly important? it clicks. jerry understands. 
jerry: no, of course not! i was joking! i know it s your birthday. summer glares at her dad, then leaves. the cake is ironic! 
[int. smith home - master bathroom - day] 
beth closes the door of the bathroom, lifts the lid of the toilet tank, and pulls out a bottle of red wine. she grabs the cup holding two toothbrushes, throws them into the sink, and pours herself a glass and gulps it down, then pours another. jerry bursts through the door, breathing heavily. beth quickly puts the wine on the vanity and stands in front of it. 
jerry: red alert, beth. today is summer s birthday. beth sighs. 
beth: i know, jerry. i seem to remember how excited you were when i gave birth to our firstborn on your favorite holiday. 
jerry: when will the world stop giving me a hard time about my arboreal festivals? they basically give us life, we should celebrate them! 
beth: jerry, normal people celebrate arbor day by planting trees. 
jerry: okay, fine. i screwed up, now are we going to try and salvage this for our daughter? or are we going to keep making jerry feel stupid? 
beth: so what s your plan then? 
jerry: let s tell summer we need to go sign some insurance forms so we can get party supplies! 
beth: why insurance forms? 
jerry: that s our excuse! it s perfect, no one will be the wiser! beth sighs again. she reveals the wine and gulps what was left in the cup. she burps. jerry frowns. her face hardens. let s go. beth 
[int. rick’s garage workshop - day] 
rick and morty, wearing aprons and safety goggles are gathered around rick’s desk. a plant grows in a small petri dish. it looks similar to a bonsai tree, but with glowing pink buds. 
rick: okay morty, this is the tricky part. if we-if we don t do this just right, we ll die, morty. rick takes a long swig from his flask. he hands morty a mirror. morty. hold it in front of the plant, morty. 
morty: geez, rick. i-i don t think this ll work. 
rick: of course it ll work, morty! zorgfillian pine trees are plant philosophers, morty. if you hold up the mirror, they ll be so entranced by the idea of identity that we can harvest it s pods without it excreting its poison gas, morty. summer walks into the garage. 
summer: guess what day it is! i ll give you a hint! 
rick: we know it s arbor day, summer. why do you think we re doing this? think before you talk! summer sighs, and walks outside the open garage door. 
[ext. front of smith home - day] 
summer walks out of the garage, the big door closing behind her. she walks across the yard and stands on the sidewalk by the street. a few flying ships pass overhead. alien and normal cars pass by. summer sighs. 
summer: (to herself) happy birthday, summer. end cold openopening titles 
[ext. front of smith home - day] 
a futuristic car pulls up and stops in front of summer. the window rolls down to reveal summer prime, a hardened summer from a post-apocalyptic dimension, wearing a cool black leather jacket with a #1 patch sewn on the sleeve. she gets out of the car and leans against the hood. 
summer: um, two questions why do you look like me? and why are you dressed like you just came from an 80 s action movie? 
summer prime: i am you, summer. a you from another dimension. and i m here to celebrate your birthday. jerry and beth walk out the front door towards the family car. jerry waves nervously at summer, not even noticing the other summer standing nearby. 
jerry: hey honey! we re just going out to get some insurance papers signed! we ll be back later for your big party! be excited! she should be excited, right beth? beth still looks extremely depressed. 
beth: sure, jerry. summer should be excited. 
jerry: see? this ll be great. love you honey! jerry and beth get into the car, reverse out the driveway and leave. 
summer: i honestly don t know why i expect anything differently. 
summer prime: my parents forgot my birthday too. that s actually why i m here. did you know there s a planet in another dimension that s sole purpose is to hold raves with hot celebrities in attendance? really? 
summer: summer prime nods, a grin on her face. 
summer prime: want to go? 
summer: um, does my dad have an irrational fear of someone seeing his toenails? 
summer prime: absolutely. summer and summer prime laugh as they get in the car and drive off. another car pulls up behind them, stopping in front of the smith home. 
[int. rick’s garage workshop - day] 
rick lifts his safety goggles, removes his apron and rubs his hands together. the zorgfillian pine tree is now completely free of its blossoms. they sit in a small dish. 
rick: we did it, morty.[burp] you can put the mirror down, morty. with its blossoms gone, the thing is now only a danger to itself. 
morty: it s weird that a tree can be prone to depression, right rick? 
rick: actually morty, plants getting depression is relatively normal. there are--there are entire fields of medicine devoted to plant therapy. 
morty: i just, i don t know what plants have to worry about. 
rick: use your head, morty. we just roofy ed it with existentialism and plucked it s precious fruit. on arbor day! 
morty: ah geez, that s--that s terrible, rick! rick takes a swig from his flask. 
rick: the universe is a wild place. but you know morty, it s actually a beautiful day, morty. i don t say this often, but it s a beautiful day. really nice. it feels like nothing could go wrong. yep. 
morty: rick sits down on a stool and takes another swig from his flask. he sighs contentedly, putting his feet up on his desk. 
rick: that s right, nothing could ruin today. he takes another swig. 
morty: yeah, plus it s summer s birthday, so, that means cake and ice cream! rick does a spit take. 
rick: it s her birthday? we re f-[bleep]-ed, morty. do-do-do-do-do you hear me? we re f-[bleep]-ed! rick springs out of his chair and runs to the washer and dryer, presses a button, causing a false wall to open up, revealing an arsenal of guns. 
morty: what s going on, rick? rick grabs the biggest gun he has, and tosses another to morty. the door to the garage explodes, filling the garage with smoke. rick and morty are on the ground, coughing. through the smoke, five different summers reveal themselves. all are identical except one is a huge beefcake summer. all are wearing cool leather jackets with numbers sewn onto the sleeves. rick coughs, holding his gun, pointing it at the summers. a foot comes down and slams his gun hand to the ground. the gun is wrestled from his fingers by summer 2, while summer 3 points a gun at his head. 
summer  2: keep still, old man. end of act i. 
[int./ext. summer prime’s spaceship] 
summer prime and summer sit in an identical version of rick’s spaceship waiting in a long line of spaceships, all waiting to get through earth’s border security. 
summer: (sarcastic) wow, quite the party. 
summer prime: yeah, border security is always a hassle. 
summer: can t we just, you know, fly in any other direction? 
summer prime: some of us have to obey the laws to get anywhere. not all of us can be rick. at the border crossing, an alien smuggler starts begging border patrol to grant him mercy. his ship is disintegrated. summer s eyes get wide at the sudden violence. not everyone is okay with his flagrant disregard of the rules. 
summer: well, that s grandpa. he does what he wants. 
summer prime: for now. but that s the amazing thing about there being an infinite number of universes, each one infinite in its own right. even someone as powerful as rick, is still insignificant. 
summer: wow. and here i thought we were going to a party, not start a nihilism book club. a ship passes through security without any issue. 
summer prime: just because life doesn t have meaning doesn t automatically make it bad! if everything is probability, that means the odds of a beneficial outcome are just as likely as our little anthill of humanity getting kicked aside by a superior life form. another ship is disintegrated by border security. the screams of the pilot are heard muffled through their ship. 
summer: but don t our actions have meaning? or is chaos only kept at bay by the halfhearted efforts of our society? the ship in front of them flies away, revealing that they are next to deal with earth s border security. 
summer prime: oh, we re next. act casual, we don t want them to look under your seat or we re toast. what? 
summer: summer s eyes get wide, gripping the seat of her chair with sudden intensity. 
[int. rick’s garage workshop - day] 
rick and morty are sitting back to back on chairs, tied together. summer #3, summer #4 and beefcake summer stand guard holding guns. summer #2 paces back and forth. 
summer  2: tell us where the fuel cell is! 
rick: i d tell you to look up my ass, but unfortunately for all of us, you already did. 
summer  2: do not play games with us! we are serious, grandpa! (looks at other summers for support) we re serious, right ladies? 
beefcake summer: (deep manly voice) yeah! you tell em. rick lifts his leg, and farts. 
rick: liberate that! the summers groan, fanning their hands in front of their faces. 
morty: ah geez, rick. i-i-i-i-just wanted some cake and ice cream, rick! why don t you just give them what they want so they ll leave? 
summer  2: yes, rick. why don t you give us what we want? tell us! beefcake summer 
rick: what i want, is to know whose idea it was for the jackets? i mean, you look great. beefcake summer blushes. 
beefcake summer: thanks, grandpa! morty snorts, causing beefcake summer to frown, causing rick to break a smile. beefcake summer roars then presses the barrel of her gun to rick s chin. you were being facetious! 
rick: i was! but in all seriousness, you should lay off whatever supplements you re taking. they are frying your brain. beefcake summer looks confused. summer 3 and 4 take beefcake summer and walk her away, consoling her. 
summer  2: just. tell us where the fuel cell is! 
rick: the fuel cell? i ve got a million fuel cells! that s like asking morty which sock he uses to masturbate in! you re gonna have to be more specific! 
summer  2: stop it rick! we re serious! we aren t leaving without the fuel cell that utilizes gravitational waves as energy. rick laughs. really laughs, like, the kind of laugh that happens when you re writing at 3 a. m. trying to figure out why the hell you didn t become an accountant. 
rick: it doesn t exist. the odds of having a working fuel cell of that design are so astronomical, that i m more likely to get struck by lightning, while getting bit by a shark that just won the lottery. 
summer  2: fine. you don t want to give it to us? we can wait. our leader is recruiting your summer as we speak. if you won t give it to us, perhaps you ll give it to her. 
rick: unlike you turds, my summer has a brain. she ll see right through your idiotic group. 
[int./ext. electric rain train - night] 
loud rave music blasts through the high speed train as it zips through the beverly hills style city. tall skyscrapers in the distance, billboards for breast augmentation, and religious style billboards with tom cruise. the flashing neon lights reflect through the smoke filled train car. colorful people of countless species throw their arms, tentacles, and other appendages in the air, bouncing to the beat of the music. summer, eyes closed, holding two glow sticks (which are also alive, and distressed) in each hand dances her heart out. 
[int. mister party town store - day] 
jerry walks down the balloon aisle. balloons for mother’s day, for deaths in the family, one even says “congratulations on your successful bris!” next to it one says, “sorry about your botched bris!” jerry grabs a “happy birthday!” balloon with a gorilla on it. he looks up the aisle to see a creepy alien that looks like et on steroids with twenty arms, staring at jerry. jerry makes uncomfortable eye contact with it. beth comes around the corner, cart full of party supplies. with jerry’s attention on her, creepy alien resumes staring. 
jerry: see? we can pull this off! we ll just get the insurance papers signed, then be home for the party! something about this shocks beth out of her depression. 
beth: insurance papers? i thought the insurance was just an excuse? 
jerry: well, insurance companies are changing now that earth is an intergalactic hub. i spoke to our adjustor and we should make changes. 
beth: what was wrong with our old policy? 
jerry: nothing, but ed says we can have coverage throughout the galaxy with a different plan. 
beth: and who is ed? 
jerry: ed? our insurance adjustor? he s the tralaxian from planet tralax? we had dinner with his family! 
beth: so you consulted with ed about our health insurance, but not your wife? jerry frowns pushing the cart to the next aisle, glancing at beth. 
jerry: okay, sorry. do you want me to postpone the meeting to discuss it? 
beth: (sarcastic) oh no! we wouldn t want to inconvenience him. it s not like i have a choice in the matter, anyway. 
jerry: i said i m sorry! you re always getting on me for not getting things done! well the universe has thrown me a bone with this new job and i m trying to be better. to be more of an active person. will you support me in that? fine! thank you! beth 
jerry: beth folds her arms. jerry sighs. 
[int. rick’s garage workshop - day] 
the summers are gathered at one end of the garage, discussing in anxious whispers. 
beefcake summer: (not whispering) he insulted our jackets! he has to pay! even though he is tied up, rick has somehow managed to slump down in his chair. 
morty: uh, rick, you have a plan, right? 
rick: no, morty, i don t have a plan. 
morty: well then how are you going to get us out of here, rick? 
rick: i don t know, morty! i-i-i-i don t always have a plan, morty. plans don t just fall out of your grandpa like a slugfillion shits applesauce! why don t you ever come up with plans, morty? huh? sometimes the sidekick gets to be the hero for an episode, morty. so what s your plan? where s your magical method of getting us out of this, morty? morty looks around at different items in the garage. the box labelled time travel stuff. the washer and dryer. rick s workbench with various odds and ends. he frowns. 
morty: maybe we could just give them what they want? 
rick: son of a bitch. you re-you re a real disappointment, morty. 
[int. electric rain train - caboose] 
the caboose looks like an alien custodial closet. the loud booms from the rave music sound far away. summer prime sits at a rickety wooden table. on the table is a small monitor displaying summer #2. summer prime impatiently places her hand on her forehead. 
summer prime: that s your solution? you re going to beat him up a little? 
summer  2: he s an old man.... 
summer prime: lieutenant, do you really believe summer s end should fail because of a little sentiment? 
summer  2: it s not sentiment, summer prime, it s mercy. summer prime slams her hand on the desk. 
summer prime: it s sentiment! we cannot protect the multiverse from him if you still care about his fate! 
summer  4  (o. s.) : (to summer 2) don t let her talk to you that way. the other summers agree, whispering encouraging words. summer prime rolls her eyes. summer enters the room. 
summer: there you are. 
summer  2: summer prime, i know he abandoned you on a broken world, but-summer prime presses a button on the monitor, it goes black. 
summer prime: enjoying yourself? 
summer: i was, until i realized how creepy this place is. so what s our next stop? the night is young! 
summer prime: i ll be honest, summer. i m not here to celebrate your birthday. i am the leader of a small group of summers that travel the multiverse helping people. we want you to join us. 
summer: that sounds really great. but unfortunately i m not a humanitarian, i m a birthday girl, and today is for partying. 
summer prime: summer, it sucks that your family forgot your birthday, but you can t use their thoughtlessness as an excuse to be self destructive. i have things to do, so, the party is over, do you want to join us or not? 
summer: i m not going to leave my family. 
summer prime: your family? i really don t have to explain to you how awful they are, right? 
summer: sure, they forgot my birthday, and i m pissed at them. but i m not going to leave them! what about school? my parents? i mean, morty sucks, but i can t leave him! 
summer prime: morty is guilty of having destroyed two civilizations, summer. two. entire. civilizations. your parents are so selfish and unaware of anyone else s needs, that it is statistically more likely that a summer dies of parental negligence than of old age. summer folds her arms, closing herself off from this speech. you asked me if chaos is only kept at bay by the efforts of society, and no matter how you look at it, you re absolutely right. with the world becoming more like rick, the more chaos reigns. but it doesn t have to be that way. we can make a difference. join our little group. summer looks hesitant. c mon, i have something to show you. 
[int. insurance office - lobby - day] 
jerry and beth enter the office lobby. 
beth: i m going to use the bathroom. 
jerry: i ll let them know we re here. beth walks to the bathroom. jerry watches her go with a satisfied smile. jerry turns to the secretary. hi, i m jerry smith, here to see ed reuben about health insurance. 
secretary: just one moment. the secretary types on her computer. beth stops at the bathroom, turns and sees jerry speaking to the secretary. she then sneaks towards the office s entrance. jerry drums on the desk with his fingers. beth opens the front door slowly, unnoticed by anyone. the secretary eyes jerry s tapping and frowns. he stops, awkwardly. ed is at lunch right now, but he should be back in a few minutes. would you like to wait? through the large front windows, beth rushes across the parking lot, hails a cab, gets in, and leaves. 
jerry: that ll be fine. jerry sits down and picks up a magazine about the mating rituals of giraffes. he opens it, turns it sideways, which causes several pages to unfold downward like a centerfold. (grimacing) oh, bad decision. bad decision. he squints open one eye, looking back at the centerfold. 
[int./ext. summer prime’s spaceship] 
summer and summer prime stop near a small dim blue star. 
summer prime: this is hip 85605. an isolated rogue neutron star. it moves through this galaxy, tearing apart solar systems, and causing chaos wherever it goes. so? summer 
summer prime: sounds a lot like your family. 
summer: i got it. so what do we do? summer prime points at a red button on the dashboard. press it. 
summer prime: summer does. a missile shoots out of the ship, flies at the neutron star, and blows up. not very impressive. um, cool? summer 
summer prime: summer, you just altered the trajectory of that star s movement. which means in 2349 years it won t tear through a nearby solar system, destroying a planet that had intelligent life spring up about 50, 000 years ago. 
summer: (coming around) oh. wow. 
summer prime: you just saved the lives of millions of people. this is what summer s end does! separate yourself from the destructive orbit of your family. join us! summer looks out her window at the star, thoughtful. 
summer: i don t know. 
summer prime: most summers end up just like mom; pregnant early, pressured to marry some dope. 
summer: so i don t get married. 
summer prime: all the rest suffer from near constant uti s from stripper poles. 
summer: (eyes wide) i ll join. 
[int. rick’s garage workshop] 
summer #3 and summer #2 approach the tied up rick and morty with long tazers. summer #4 watches with arms folded. 
summer  3: all right you two, are you ready for some real pain? 
beefcake summer: yeah! real pain! beefcake summer howls like a wolf. rick and morty groan. 
rick: just do something! actual torture would be less torture than this! summer 3 clicks a button on her tazer, electricity buzzing between the metal rods. 
summer  2: i m going to taze you! 
morty: (bored voice) oh no, please don t. 
summer  2: why aren t you guys taking us seriously? summer prime s ship lands in the driveway. summer prime and summer enter the garage. summer prime rips the tazer out of summer 3 s hand and tazes rick. rick screams. morty yells. 
morty: rick, oh no! oh no! summer grabs summer prime s arm. stop it! summer 
summer prime: summer, rick is the rogue neutron star. this is what needs to happen for the greater good! summer looks down, then nods. summer prime commences the tazing. rick screams. 
morty: oh no! rick, rick, are you okay rick? oh no! oh--oh no! rick! the tazing continues. the summers grimace. oh! oh! oh no! oh no, rick! the tazing stops. 
rick: f[bleep] ck me, that sucked. summer prime whips the tazer around, smacking his face with the butt of the weapon. morty struggles in his bindings. the other summer s avert their eyes. rick spits out some blood at summer prime s feet. she grabs him by his lab coat and pulls him up towards her. 
summer prime: give us the fuel cell. 
rick: it doesn t exist! summer prime punches rick in the face. his eye starts swelling a purple color. i-i don t know who pissed in your fruit loops this morning, but no amount of guantanamo-ing is going to get me to tell you where a completely hypothetical fuel cell is. summer prime tazes rick again. summer looks down, summer 3 puts her hand on summer prime s shoulder. summer prime shoves her away, knocking her down. the other summers gasp. stop it! morty 
summer prime: tell me where the fuel cell is! rick is breathing hard. drool coming out of his mouth. 
rick: wow, what the hell did your rick do to you to make you hate me so much? my rick? 
summer prime: summer prime steps back from rick. her eyes grow distant. behind her, half faded in the background, a vision of a world on fire. rivers of blood, buildings crumbling, roads lined with abandoned cars. distant cries in the moonlit night. smoke, heavy in the air. remnants of a broken world. the earth still spins when the last breath of humanity is spent. we are fools to deny we were born astride a grave. summer prime blinks, looking down at a confused rick. the vision fades away. my rick abandoned me. leaving me stranded on a cronenberged earth. rick and morty s eyes get big. f[bleep] ck. 
rick: f[bleep] ck. morty 
[int./ext. taxi cab - day] 
an alien cab driver with oozing orifices, huge bug-like eyes, and ant-like limbs, wearing the clothes of a typical immigrant cab driver, drives beth in the back seat. beth looks miserable. 
alien cab driver: hey lady, what s buggin you? 
beth: funny. (sighs) look, i don t want to talk about it. 
alien cab driver: as a licensed cab driver from the horphiblydips galaxy, i also have a degree in primate psychology. i m literally a cosmic mentor. speak your heart, darlin . 
beth: today is my daughter s birthday. 
alien cab driver: uh oh, while the trunk may be where passenger s usually put their baggage, it sounds like you brought yours with you. 
beth: it s the usual story. got pregnant at 17, married the father because it seemed right. 
alien cab driver: tale as old as time. or my ma! you know what i m sayin ? 
beth: and now, as if today isn t enough of a reminder that i feel like a failure, my husband is trying to get us new health insurance. 
alien cab driver: somethin tells me this isn t about the insurance, lady. tears fill beth s eyes. she wipes them away, sniffing. 
beth: i lied about being 18 so that we could get married. i don t know why i suddenly cared about not having a baby out of wed-lock a week after i almost aborted the thing. but it suddenly seemed really important. 
alien cab driver: let it out, hun. let it out. 
beth: but i m reminded of my lie every time i fill out any form requiring my date of birth. i ve always dealt with it in the past, but i realized that my daughter is now older than i was when i made such a life altering decision. i can t help but realize what i ve missed in life. all because of that lie. alien cab driver pulls over. he turns around in his seat. 
alien cab driver: that s heavy stuff, hun. have you told your husband? 
beth: jerry already feels self conscious enough about our relationship. i can t burden him with this. 
alien cab driver: darlin , what makes you think that your marriage will be better if you don t tell the truth? i can t promise your husband will understand what you need, but if you tell him, at least he can try. beth sighs nervously, looking out the window of the cab. 
beth: hey, we re back at the insurance adjustor s office. 
alien cab driver: i told you, as a cab driver from the horphiblydips galaxy, it s not my job to drive you where you want. it s my job to get you where you need. 
beth: wow. thank you. beth chuckles embarrassingly as she wipes away tears. the alien cab driver does the same. they both smile as beth opens her door to get out. 
alien cab driver: whoa whoa whoa, that ll be 50! what am i, a charity? 
beth: 50 bucks? that s bullshi--cut to 
[int. rick’s garage workshop] 
rick and morty are still tied up. the summers are gathered nearby, with summer prime standing in front of rick. 
summer prime: you destroyed my world, and then you abandoned me to it! 
rick: well if you want to get real technical, it was morty here that destroyed your world. 
morty: aw, geez, rick. 
summer prime: but after wandering the wastes, i found your ship. exactly what i needed to leave my world behind. my ship? rick 
summer prime: it s my ship now. parked just out front. maybe i ll use it to level this place when we re done with it. 
rick: your group is a joke! want to know the real impact of summer s end? most rick s just stage an accident for their summer the night before her 18th birthday. if you really want to help the other summers, then leave the ricks alone! 
summer prime: do you think i want to be here bothering you? you re the only rick in the multiverse that has gotten the tech to work. we need it to power our new world, where we ll help people, help summers, and anyone else cast off by the rick s of their world. 
rick: that s a lot of crap you re piling up there. reeeeeeeal steamy load. don t pretend this is for humanitarian reasons. 
summer  2: of course it is. if we had free renewable energy, think of how much we could do for others. 
rick: or you know, reverse the flow of gravitational waves and create a black hole anywhere you want it. 
summer prime: huh, never thought of that. no wonder you re hiding it. 
rick: listen, you--you little shit. don t you think if i had a working fuel cell that i d be using it? instead i m stuck using dark matter like an asshole! the tech doesn t work! summer prime fishes her hand into rick s lab coat, pulling out his flask. she holds it aloft, threateningly. 
summer prime: don t lie to me. we detected the anomalous gravitational waves coming from your coordinates. 
summer: grandpa, rick, will you please just give it to us? 
rick: stay out of this, summer. summer prime holds the flask, threateningly. 
summer prime: don t make me use this. morty laughs. 
morty: what are you--what are you gonna do with that? cure rick s alcoholism? 
rick: shut up, morty! there is real fear in rick s eyes. something about this flask has shaken him. morty and the summer s eyes go wide. summer prime smirks. end of act ii. 
[int. insurance office - lobby - day] 
creepy alien enters the office and sits. jerry looks up, realizes it is the alien from the party store, and uncomfortably looks back at his magazine. creepy alien picks up a magazine and starts reading. jerry frowns, clearing his throat. creepy alien slowly lowers its magazine, intensely staring at jerry again. 
jerry: okay, are you stalking me? excuse me? creepy alien 
jerry: (stands up angrily) you heard me! staring at me! following me around! 
creepy alien: wow, we must all look alike to you! you know, i was a respected surgeon on my planet! 
jerry: oh oh oh, i m so sorry. a surgeon, huh? my wife is a surgeon. a horse surgeon. which is a real surgeon. phew, i m really digging myself a hole here. through the windows of the office door, beth approaches. she stops at the doors, takes a deep breath, then walks in. honey! what are you doing? i thought you were in the bathroom. 
beth: no jerry, i was going to gamble at the indian reservation. what? jerry 
beth: but i came back, because i need you to understand that i can t keep lying about my age. i mean i ve been doing it for 18 years and it has become this symbolic representation of the fact that i ve sacrificed every dream i ve had in life, all to marry you. 
creepy alien: daaaaaaayuuuuuuuumn. 
beth: hey asshole, can t you see we are in the middle of talking? 
jerry: (gesturing between him and beth) you see this? this is a private conversation. creepy alien looks down at his magazine. the secretary awkwardly types at her computer. 
beth: i don t have anything against you, jerry. you ve done nothing but fight for the affections of a woman who has been half invested in this relationship at best. you deserve better! i deserve better! 
creepy alien: (coughs) divorce. (coughs) excuse me. so sorry. jerry s eyes go wide with worry. beth frowns in concern. 
[int. rick’s garage workshop] 
summer prime holds rick’s flask. summer stands nearby, looking confused. 
summer prime: don t make me start pressing buttons on this thing. 
beefcake summer: (manly voice) what are you doing, summer prime? summer prime unscrews the metal lid. 
rick: don t. we can talk about this, it-it-it doesn t have to be this way. 
summer prime: you made it this way, every time a rick abandoned one of us! summer prime flips a switch, a strip of red lights light up on the side of the flask. summer 2 puts her hand on summer prime s shoulder. 
summer  2: hey, why don t we go. we can make do without him. right ladies? summer prime pulls out a gun and points it at summer 2. whoa! summer prime what s going on? 
summer prime: back the hell up. (to rick) so who should it be? jerry? nah. what about your daughter? beloved beth. no. morty? (shakes her head) morty s are expendable. you d just get another. what? mortysummer prime how about your summer? the one you didn t abandon? summer prime is about to press one of the red buttons when 
rick: ship, open fire! a panel on summer prime s ship opens up, revealing laser guns. rick yells, heaving his body to the side, knocking his and morty s chairs onto their side. rick kicks summer s feet out from under her. the guns open fire, lasers shooting all through the garage. equipment explodes, smoke fills the room as silhouettes of alternate summers scream, falling to the ground. 
[int. insurance office - lobby - day] 
beth and jerry still stand in the middle of the lobby. secretary types awkwardly, creepy alien stares. 
jerry: i don t know what you want me to say, beth! i want you to be happy, i do! i don t want you to feel like you ve thrown away your identity. but... what do we do? 
beth: i don t know, jerry. but i need a change. 
jerry: (thinking about it) well, i was waiting till your birthday to tell you, but with my new job, we can probably afford you to finally go to medical school. beth blinks, the realization of what he just said setting in. 
beth: what? wow. wow! 
jerry: is this good? is this helping you feel better about everything? 
beth: yes! wow, thank you, jerry! beth and jerry hug. secretary taps on her keyboard. 
jerry: to be honest, i m just relieved you don t want to divorce me. 
secretary: um. i hate to break it to you, but according to section 2. 133 of intergalactic marriage law, because you lied about being underage, your marriage isn t legally recognized on earth, or anywhere in this galaxy. beth and jerry s eyes go wide. they pull apart from their hug. jerry awkwardly laughs. beth blinks, her face blank. 
[int. rick’s garage workshop - day] 
the ship’s lasers continue to fire, the garage exploding around them. 
rick: ship, cease fire! the lasers stop firing. rick, and morty cough, their bindings now loose. they wave their hands through the smoke. 
morty: that was brilliant, rick! 
rick: your old grandpa still has a few more tricks up his sleeve, morty. as the smoke begins to dissipate, they notice summer isn t where rick kicked her to the ground. wait, where s your sister morty? 
summer prime: right here, old man. the smoke dissipates. summer prime stands above rick and morty, alternate summer s litter the garage, dead. summer prime has summer in a headlock, holding rick s flask in the other hand. rick quickly grabs a discarded gun and points it at summer prime. 
rick: that s--that s it. summer s end is gone. just let my summer go and i won t kill you. 
summer prime: your summer? i m your summer! me! 
rick: i m not giving you the fuel cell. and i m not going to let you kill my grandkids. 
summer prime: don t pretend like you care about them! if you cared you wouldn t have this! she shakes his flask. 
morty: what is she talking about, rick? 
summer prime: this isn t just a flask, morty. at the press of a button, he can cause a chip he planted in your brain to explode. 
summer: wait, so every time you ve been annoyed with us, and took out your flask, you were a button press away from killing us? that s f[bleep] cked up! 
rick: it s a fail safe! excuse me for wanting to have an easy way of putting you out of your misery if you got seriously injured, or turned into zombie! 
morty: aw, geez, rick! 
summer prime: give me the fuel cell or i start pushing buttons! 
rick: fine! you win! it s in a temporal canister, hidden in the orbit of a nearby blackhole, the coordinates are- 
summer prime:-i m not a fool! it s here! tell me where it is or summer dies! 
morty: give it to her, rick! 
summer: please! grandpa rick! rick frowns. he looks summer prime in the eyes. he squints his eyes in scrutiny. 
rick: this is bullshit. you re a summer, you don t have it in you. summer prime and rick lock eyes. 
summer prime: you don t know what i ve had to do to survive. (to summer) happy birthday, summer. summer prime presses the button. summer bursts into tears. noooo! 
rick: summer prime laughs villainously. summer s eyes are wide as tears stream down her face. she looks around as if waiting for the axe to fall. suddenly, summer prime gasps, grabbing her head, surprise evident on her face. she falls to the ground. rick s eyes go wide. morty covers his eyes. 
summer prime: no! you ll pay, for this! there s a sickening sound, like an exploding slurpee inside of a refrigerator. summer prime falls to the ground, her eyes looking in different directions. blood trickles out of her nose. rick lets out a breath of relief. 
rick: you kids all right? no. 
morty: summer doesn t answer. she is staring at the bodies of the other summer s, her eyes wide. rick helps her up. 
rick: get inside, summer. me and morty ll bury them. 
morty: what? rick, you made me bury myself! why does she get out of it? 
rick: it s her birthday, you freakin moron. you don t have to bury alternate dimensional versions of yourself on your birthday, okay morty? is that a deal, morty? summer s face hardens. 
summer: no, i ll help. i--i want to help. 
[ext. smith home - backyard] 
next to two slight mounds in the back lawn, rick, morty, and summer dig holes. 
[int./ext. smith family car] 
jerry and beth drive home in silence. jerry glances at beth, worried, while beth just stares out the window. birthday decorations and a grocery store cake sit on the back seat. 
[ext. smith home - backyard] 
summer uses her foot to push the body of summer prime into a hole. rick frowns, before dragging summer #3 into the same hole. morty and summer drag a few more, all unceremoniously dropped into the mass grave of summer’s end. 
[int. smith home - living room] 
rick and morty come in from the back yard. morty sits down on the couch, turning on the tv. summer enters, staring off at nothing. rick sees the look on her face, his shoulders slump. he sighs. 
rick: follow me, summer. 
[int. rick’s garage workshop] 
rick and summer enter the still destroyed garage. rick presses a button on the wall, it slides open to reveal a safe. he opens it, and pulls out a small metallic orb. pale blue light emerges from the seams. 
rick: this is the fuel cell they were looking for. he looks at the glowing light for a moment, before sighing and giving it to summer. i know it s morbid, but this is what the summer s died for, you should have it. summer stares at it, still shocked. rick sighs. summer the only reason why you didn t die today, is because the rick from this dimension used a different frequency than i used. there s some scary crap out there, summer. i ve tried to protect you kids from most of it, but i can t always protect you from yourselves. with that fuel cell, you can keep our family safe when i no longer can. summer looks up at rick, light glowing on her face. 
summer: the other summer. she said that you don t actually care about anyone. that the universe is random. that life doesn t have meaning. 
rick: some people find god in a burnt piece of toast, summer. meaning is what you make of it. summer s eyes get wide. this isn t what she s hoping for. rick sighs, he walks to his desk and picks up one of the pods of the zorgfillian pine tree. you see this, summer? this tree s fruit was plucked away while it was stuck trying to find meaning. this isn t some saturday morning cartoon with a nicely packaged moral of the story at the end of it to tell you how to feel. 
summer: but grandpa, if i can t find meaning in this, then what separates me from her? 
rick: literally everything. from the fact that you have that fuel cell, to the fact that she s dead and you re not. and so what if you have a little super villain in you. now morty knows not to cross you! summer looks sick. sorry about your birthday. summer hugs rick, he resists, before hugging her back. rick leaves the garage, leaving summer alone. she pulls out her phone and holds it close to the orb. her battery charges almost instantaneously. cool. 
summer: beth and jerry pull up in their car. they see summer in the garage and awkwardly start pulling birthday party stuff out of the car. 
jerry: oh, hey summer! you ready for your birthday surprise? summer walks up to her parents and hugs them both. they both look surprised before smiling at each other and hugging her back. happy birthday, summer. 
beth: we love you, honey. i know. summer 
jerry: should i even ask about the garage? no. summerfade out. roll credits. tag 
[int. smith home - living room] 
rick, morty, and summer sit on the couch with the tv on. jerry and beth hand out slices of cake to each of them. 
morty: you know, summer. this isn t-this isn t that bad of a birthday. 
summer: you re right, morty! who cares about the existential crisis that led to a grisly mass death, because hey, at least mom and dad aren t fighting. 
rick: wow, you ve been a real whiny bitch today, summer. why don t you count your blessings? your entire family is sober for once. usually your mom is at least a little hammered by now. 
jerry: rick, please don t talk about my wife like that. 
rick: i wasn t talking to beth, jerry. i was clearly addressing summer. 
summer: i m just saying that we might be setting ourselves up for disappointment if the bar of quality for a good day is whether or not mom and dad threaten divorce. beth and jerry look at each other, before leaving the room. 
[int. smith home - dining room] 
jerry and beth rush into the room. 
beth: are we going to tell them? 
jerry: what, that the outdated institution that was symbolically holding their parent s relationship together by a thread doesn t actually exist, and that the hassle of getting a divorce was often the only thing keeping us together? 
beth: yes, that s exactly what i mean! 
jerry: i don t know, maybe we should wait a few weeks? we don t want to spoil her birthday even more, right? 
beth: but morty s birthday is in a month! 
jerry: fine, we ll tell them on christmas! fine. 
beth: beth hands him a small plate with a slice of cake on it. 
jerry: can i have the one with the racecar? beth sighs. fine. 
beth: they switch plates, before joining the others. fade out. the end 
[ext. rest stop asteroid - space] 
a rest stop sits atop an asteroid. dozens of ships refuel as aliens enter and leave the rest area when-- --rick and morty burst through the doors in a hurry. 
rick: come on, morty! we're going to be late! 
morty: i'm running as fast as i can, rick. 
rick: then run faster than you can, morty! do you have any idea what the zenerastians do to latecomers? 
morty: no... is it bad? 
rick: it's butt stuff, morty. really freaky butt stuff. so we've gotta-- (rick stops. stares at the empty parking space in front of them, then at the ticket on the parking sign.) 
rick: great. do you see what you've done? 
morty: what did i do? 
rick: your pathetic bladder got our ship towed. 
morty: towed? just for parking? isn't this a rest stop? 
rick: morty, that's not the point! do you have any idea how many hit and runs that ship has been implicated in? 
morty: hit and runs? how many people have you hit, rick? 
rick: they were just drosophimites, morty. they're tiny. almost as tiny as your dick. (off morty's reaction) i'm sorry. that was uncalled for. but they're small, morty. i can't keep track of how many of those things i hit. it's just impossible. 
morty: so what do we do now? 
rick: we've got to get to the nearest security outpost. and of course the portal gun is still in the ship. 
morty: geez rick, you should really stop leaving that thing in there all the time. 
rick: (rolls his eyes) spare me the lecture, mr. i-refuse-to-pee-in-a-bottle. we're going to have to do this the hard way. 
morty: the hard way? cut to 
[ext. space] 
rick and morty pedal through space on a tandem bike with a glass dome around them. a spaceship passes by and in the window, alien children point and laugh. 
morty: i'm getting pretty tired, rick. 
rick: so's my wallet, morty. these things don't come cheap. from the rear, rick takes a long swig from a bottle. he lazily pedals, clearly not putting in any work. c'mon, morty. i'm doing all the work here.

living room: summer stares at her phone on the couch. a vacuum cleaner sits nearby, unused. 
jerry  (o. s.) : that's insane! 
bathroom: beth and jerry argue in the bathroom with cleaning tools in their hands. 
beth: what is so insane about me asking you to clean the bathroom? 
jerry: it's the bathroom. it's where we clean things. it's by definition already clean. 
beth: oh really,"by definition"? please tell me, in what dictionary does it say that? 
jerry: the urban one...? (off beth's reaction) forget it. if you want to waste your time, be my guest. jerry drops the cleaning tools and stomps out of the bathroom. 
living room: jerry enters the living room. he sees summer. before he can open his mouth-- 
summer: just taking a break. jerry snatches the vacuum cleaner. starts to vacuum with an angry look on his face. oh my god, dad. that is so loud. jerry ignores summer's complaint. he tries to vacuum the corner of the room, but the vacuum cleaner's power shuts off. he looks back to see the plug has fallen out of the outlet. he goes back to plug it in, but the cord is too short. he pulls on it, but the vacuum falls over. his anger reaches a boiling point. 
jerry: where's the other outlet? how do you expect a man to live with only one outlet?! 
summer: calm down, dad. there's one behind the bookshelf. jerry moves to the bookshelf. pulls it out just an inch. he peers in and finds the outlet, but sees something odd next to it. summer? jerry 
summer: (annoyed) what. is it another skittle? 
jerry: hey, you know how much i love the green ones! no, i think it's a... button? summer groans. she gets up and takes a look behind the bookshelf. next to the outlet, there is in fact a bright redbutton. 
summer: (shrugs) i don't know. probably something grandpa rick put in. summer returns to her spot on the couch. beth! jerry 
bathroom: beth wipes the bathroom floor. 
jerry  (o. s.) : rick did something to the house again! beth stares with longing eyes at the tile cleanser in her hand. 
beth: just one sip... and it's all over... honey?! 
jerry  (o. s.) : beth shakes her head and sets the cleanser down. not today. beth 
[ext. goruscant - space] 
rick and morty pedal by a large planet covered in strobingneon lights. 
rick: hey look, morty. we made it in record time. maybe we don't need a ship after all. 
morty: uh, this doesn't look like a security outpost to me... 
rick: it's not, morty. this is goruscant. the entire planet is one big casino. dance music gets louder and louder as rick and morty approach the planet. 
[ext. goruscant - night] 
rick and morty land their bike in a street filled with neon signs and drunk aliens. as they step off, two hookers immediately jump on and ride off with high-pitched giggles. 
rick: aw man. now i'll never get that deposit back. rick heads down the street as morty catches up to him. 
morty: why are we here, rick? is it to buy another ship? 
rick: buy another ship?! i made that ship when i was a boy. a boy, morty. that's my baby. i don't think i would be lying if i said i cared more about that ship than you or summer. 
morty: then why are we here? 
rick: i need bribe money. space police are total pigs. both literally and figuratively. they arrive outside a giant entranceway into the building that stretches across the entirety of the planet. 
[int. casino - night] 
rick and morty enter the casino to find thousands of aliens gambling at various games. 
morty: whoa, rick. this looks just like a casino back on earth. 
rick: subtle differences, morty. they pass by a craps table. an alien throws the pair of dice, but as we get a closer look they are actually tiny, cuboid aliens that groan in pain with each bounce. 
morty: look, they have blackjack! morty points to a table, where a dealer hands out cards. rick looks past and spots a security guard glaring at him. 
rick: (nervously) let's keep going, morty. rick pushes morty away from the blackjack tables. 
morty: what was that about, rick? 
rick: years back, i saw that kevin spacey movie about counting cards and decided to try my hand at it. 
morty: how did that go? 
rick: meh, it was fine, but somehow the majority of the team wasn't asian? i mean, i don't like to prescribe to stereotypes, but come on. (off morty's reaction) oh, you meant the counting cards. yeah, i made a buttload of money. the sore losers decided to send my picture out to every casino in the universe. i can't go within fifty feet of a blackjack table out of fear of being treated like a total a-hole. 
cash exchange: rick and morty walk up to a booth, where an alien clerk greets them. 
clerk: chips for cash. would you like some chips for cash? rick kneels down. eye level with morty. 
rick: look, morty, if we want to go home, we're going to have to make some sacrifices. 
morty: what are you saying, rick...? 
rick: just that sacrifices are sometime inevitable, morty. it's the defining trait of the human condition. that and naming sex positions after animals. 
morty: can you get to the point, rick? 
rick: just trust me, morty. rick stands up and speaks to the clerk. i'd like to exchange this human child for some chips, please. morty's jaw drops. 
morty: w, what are you, why, what is, huh? 
rick: he doesn't have a speech impediment. he's just very excited. the clerk nods. gestures next to him to a machine similar to an mri but upright. 
clerk: that there is the walk-in machine. that's where you walk in to the machine. rick nudges morty towards the machine. 
morty: rick, no! stop! 
rick: trust me, morty. it'll all be fine. morty still looks scared out of his mind, but he steps into the machine. the clerk pushes a button. the machine whirs to life. a light scans the entirety of morty's body. it finishes with a microwave ding. the machine then projects the results of the scan in a holographic image age-14 height-5'4"weight-127 lbs strength-low stamina-low general attractiveness-low penile span-nothing to write home about overall worth-125 kuracs morty steps out from the machine and stares up at his stats. 125 kuracs?! this is highway robbery, buddy. just look at him. (gestures to morty) he's a young, strapping man with a world of potential. morty's face brightens at rick's words. just look at those arms. they could, could lift some boxes. got a lot of boxes to lift down there? you know how many, how many ladies this kid-- (stifles in laughter) i'm sorry, i can't. just give me the chips. the clerk hands rick a stack of chips. well, good luck, morty. i'll see you on the other side. 
morty: what, rick--as morty stares at his grandfather abandon him, two burly alien security guards appear and take morty by the arms. they drag him away through a door. rick! rick ignores morty's pleas for help as he peruses the various games at play. as he walks by the blackjack tables, the security guard speaks into his walkie-talkie while glaring at rick. rick moves on until he stops by a half-filled poker table and takes a seat. 
dealer: welcome, sir. 
rick: just deal. 
casino - corridor: the guards drag morty through a dark corridor. they stop in the middle at a random spot. a guard places his hand on the wall. a light scans the hand and the wall beeps. the section of the wall elevates, revealing secret steps. 
morty: whoa, that's pretty cool--the guard pushes morty down the steps. morty screams at the top of his lungs. the constant scream gets punctured with intermittent painful groans. 
casino - poker table: each player at the table, including rick, have two"cards"in front of them. i put cards in quotations because the cards are actually tiny, obese aliens. rick lifts the fat rolls of the card aliens in front of him, revealing a 2 of spades and a 4 of hearts. the card aliens giggle and squeal every time they are handled. the dealer lays the fifth and final card alien in center of the table. roll call! 
dealer: the aliens in the center giggle out the cards they represent 3 of diamonds, 6 of hearts, king of clubs, jack of spades, and 5 of diamonds. rick's face slightly twitches in glee as he hears the last card called. he was hoping for that straight. he glares at the rest of those still in the game an alien with an antenna and an alien in a wifebeater. 
rick: whoa-ho-ho! somebody's got that straight. is it you? i bet it's you. that guy's been hiding grins all game! (looks at wifebeater) how bout you? no? then who could it be? maybe no one has it... both aliens glare at rick, who finishes off his martini. i raise. call. wifebeater 
antenna: they both toss in chips. 
rick: uh oh. somebody's got good cards. rick tosses in chips to call. his stack is dangerously low. roll call! 
dealer: the card aliens go in order as they laugh out the cards they represent. both wifebeater and antenna have decent cards a royal pair and even a three of a kind. when the roll call reaches rick's cards, they reveal the cards finishing off the straight. rick laughs, nearly falling out of his seat. 
rick: oh man! what a twist. it was me the entire time! rick pulls in the stack of chips. antenna and wifebeater get up and flick him off as they leave. what, come on guys. i thought we had a good game. (mutters) sore losers... rick looks to the remaining players. another round? 
casino underground: morty falls down the steps for what seems like a lifetime. finally, he hits the bottom. he stays on the ground, moaning in pain, before looking up to see...... an underground factory filled with child laborers. the children toil away, pushing revolving levers, mining for minerals, and anything else you can think of necessary to run a casino. morty stares wide eyed when a small alien in brown robes appears in front of him. 
morty: hey, little guy. the small alien goes on a tirade in an unintelligible alien language. he pushes morty through the underground factory. where am i? the small alien shouts in his alien language. i, i don't understand... morty gets pushed forward into a large cage. the small alien locks the door behind morty. wait, please! my grandpa rick said he would come back for me! 
luke  (o. s.) : no, he won't. morty turns around to see dozens of alien children staring at him. they all have grown out hair and piercings in odd places. they almost look emo. one of them steps forward. he looks to be the oldest and the leader of the group. this is luke (16). every word he speaks rolls out in an angst-ridden inflection. that's what they all say. but, like, they never have. 
morty: who are you? where am i? why do you have piercings in your eyelids? 
luke: what, do you have a problem with my eyelids? are you some kind of eyelid police? 
morty: i don't think that's a real thing... 
luke: you think you're better than me? 
morty: how are you getting to these conclusions? 
luke: you're one of us now, so get off your high-horse. 
morty: one of you? 
luke: you've like, totally been abandoned. 
morty: no, i haven't. my grandpa rick just needs to win the money to get our ship back. luke a ship, huh? what about the rest of you? luke gestures to the children behind him. they all speak out in a jumbled orchestra of sad stories. the few that can be heard 
children: pay off loan sharks. cruise vacation. support her drug addiction. i've got nothing better to do. 
morty: wow... i'm so sorry to hear that. 
luke: we don't want your pity. we're glad to be here. we don't even, like, need adults anyways. 
morty: so you just work here? like slaves? 
luke: it's not slavery. we totally want this. 
morty: whatever man. i'm just going to wait here until my grandpa shows up. 
luke: that's up to you, bro. but while you're here, you're gonna have to do the work. work? mortycut to 
casino underground: morty and a dozen other children push a large screw that powers a complex mechanism. morty slips on the ground. another one of the small aliens in brown robes whips morty. 
morty: ah! i'm up! i'm up! morty quickly returns to his position to push the screw. 
casino - poker table: the card aliens call out the cards they represent. by the time they get to rick, it is clear that he has won again based off the other players'expressions. 
rick: yeah, baby! let it rain! wubba lubba dub dub! (not sure if i should keep that in) several aliens leave the table. as rick gathers his winnings (his chip stack has gotten pretty damn big), an alien couple (late 30s) and three toddlers approach the table. the wife wears a gaudy sundress and a visor. 
wife: oh look, honey! how about a game of poker! 
husband: (unenthusiastic) sure, sweetie. i'll be at the bar. the wife sits down at the table as her husband takes the three toddlers over to the bar. 
wife: how are you all doing? i'm edith bloppers. what are your names? the entire table stares back in silence. 
edith: i'm on my thirty-fourth anniversary with my sweetums. she waves at her husband at the bar, who glances over, rolls his eyes, and turns away. husband (to bartender) make it strong. like, can't feel my tentacles strong. at the poker table 
edith: we thought it'd hand at some of learned all the so get ready to chips. be fun to try our these card games. i rules this morning hand over your she cackles, spraying mucus out through the tentacles on her face. whoops! so sorry about that. rick and the other aliens give each other suggestive glances. we've got ourselves a sucker. 
later: edith pulls in a huge pot. 
edith: i can't believe it! i won! rick and the rest of the table stare in awe as edith sprays out mucus in joy. 
casino underground - cage: morty catches his breath as he lies on the ground, locked in the cage with the other children. he looks over and sees luke point and laugh at morty with a group of his lackeys. 
girl  (o. s.) : don't let them get to you. morty turns around to see a stunning teenage alien girl (14) smiling at him. her hair is tied in a clean pony-tail and she has no piercings. a stark difference from her peers. morty stammers, unable to get out even a coherent word. luke's a total jerk. 
morty: yeah... t, totally. 
girl: how was your first day on the job? 
morty: (acting tough) oh, pretty easy. i mean, i work out pretty often so, you know? the girl giggles. morty smiles, already smitten with this stranger. hey, how come you don't look like the other kids? 
girl: they've all given up on adult authority. they've resigned themselves to a sad, pseudo-emo, post-punk state. and you? morty 
girl: i'm still holding out. 
morty: i'm sorry to hear about your parents. it's awful. 
girl: it's alright. i'm sure i'll see them soon. i bet they're just stuck on some planet, praying to get back to me. 
morty: yeah. for sure. the cage doors burst open. the children all turn to see the robed aliens enter. the children instinctively press to the back of the cage. follow me! 
girl: the girl takes morty's hand and hides among the rest of the children. 
morty: what's going on? 
girl: just do as i say and keep your head low. the robed aliens scan the frightened children before stopping at luke. they grab him. 
luke: no! please! i went last week! what about the new kid! take the new kid! the robed aliens tie luke up and carry him out of the cage. the children all rush to the bars to see luke taken to a large machine, containing a giant see-through dome. 
morty: what is that? 
girl: that's how they create the laughing gas. 
morty: laughing gas? 
girl: yes. the casino wants to ensure the visitors have a good time despite losing money, so they pump laughing gas into the casino air. morty stares in awe as luke gets strapped to a chair in the giant dome. 
casino underground - dome: luke sits in the glass dome, terrified. 
luke: please! i'm, like, totally begging you, man! the robed aliens attach an apparatus to luke's head. they exit the dome. from outside, the robed aliens press a button on a dashboard. the machine whirs to life. a comedy special projects onto the glass dome. luke tries to shut his eyes, but giant metal arms emerge from the dome and wrench them open. luke stares, helpless. a happy tune plays while an intro to a tv special projects on the dome wall. on dome screen two teenage aliens appear in a school setting. 
teenage alien 1: so, did you do mr. blixfrrrg's homework assignment? 
teenage alien 2: no, i didn't. did you? luke shakes in terror. 
luke: it's not even funny. it's not even funny. it's not even... 
teenage alien 1: neither did i. aren't you afraid we're going to get in trouble? 
teenage alien 2: no, because... i'm mr. blixfrrrg! (removes his skin, revealing an adult alien) and you've got detention. canned laughter plays as the teenage alien makes the"home alone"face at the camera. luke bursts out laughing. starts to tear up. 
[casino underground - cage - continuous]
(the other children and the girl all laugh at the footage. morty raises an eyebrow, totally confused.) 
morty: what? but, that's not even remotely funny. the girl wipes a tear from her face as her chuckling dies down. 
girl: many of us have been here so long we barely have any idea what comedy is anymore. 
casino underground - dome: luke laughs uncontrollably, when the dome sucks up the air! luke's laughter gets siphoned up into a tube, which leads into the machine. loud, processed noises echo until at the end, a sponge pops out. the laughter dies down until luke slumps into his seat with a jaded expression. eyes glazed with apathy. the robed aliens enter the dome and drag luke out of the seat. 
casino underground - cage: morty's eyes are wide with fear. 
morty: holy shit. 
[int. living room - day] 
beth peers behind the bookshelf and sees the red button. 
beth: okay, jerry. there's a button. so what? 
jerry: what do you mean"so what"? what do you think it does? 
beth: i don't know, but i'm sure my dad put it there for a good reason. 
jerry: aren't you curious? what if it activates some defense system that'll vaporize the mailman? or what if it releases thousands of balloons and we become the house from up so we can survive in case of a planet-wide flood? 
beth: just leave it alone, jerry. beth leaves the room. jerry pokes his head back behind the bookshelf, staring at the red button with an intense curiosity. 
[int. casino underground - cage - night] 
morty sits in the corner of the cage, still shocked from what he had just seen. the girl sits next to him and rubs his shoulder. 
girl: hey, are you okay? 
morty: yeah, i'm just shocked by what i saw in there. it's crazy you guys have to suffer through that. 
girl: it's no big deal. you get used to it. 
morty: no, it is a big deal. it really is. i don't know how you stay so... so... hopeful all the time. the girl shrugs. they sit in silence for a beat. 
girl: hey, you haven't gotten a tour of the place yet, have you? no. morty 
girl: come with me. the children file out of the cage. as they emerge, the girl takes morty's hand and they sneak away from the rest of the group. start montage 
casino underground: the carpenters'top of the world or some similar overly-saccharine song plays in the background. the girl leads morty through the labor camp. they pass by children getting whipped as they--push a giant screw.--work on an assembly line, building roulette wheels.--mine for minerals. a small child finds a shiny jewel. they take it to a robed alien, who snatches it from the child's hand and pushes them back towards the mining shaft. back at the casino rick pushes in a large stack of chips with a cocky smile. edith responds by pushing forward a larger stack, to rick's annoyance. the girl and morty slide down a shaft meant for trolleys containing minerals. they jump across a lava stream that is used to mold metals. casino rick glares at edith as she pulls in a huge pot. she cackles, spraying mucus at the rest of the table. a robed alien spots the girl and morty. the girl grabs a rock and chucks it at the alien's head. they run away laughing. the girl and morty run away from a group of robed aliens. they reach a dead end with a ledge they can't reach. the girl crouches to one knee and looks at morty with a smile. morty steps on her hands and she pushes him up. morty climbs over the ledge, then grabs the girl's hand, pulling her over. the robed aliens reach for the ledge, unable to grab a hold. the girl and mort hold hands and spin around, dancing in front of a dome while a child gets the laughter sucked out of them. the robed aliens circle them. the girl and morty can't even bother to notice. they are too preoccupied with the other and their love. the robed aliens grab the girl and morty, tearing them apart. they cry and beg for each other. their hands reach each other for a fleeting moment. they both smile, before the robed aliens separate them. end montage 
casino - poker table: the dealer deals the new card aliens out to the table. rick glares at edith suspiciously. the rest of the table immediately checks their cards, but edith ignores the cards and instead stares at the various players'expressions. when her gaze reaches rick, edith reveals a slight mischievous grin. they have a short stare-down when rick spots the corner of one of her tentacles peeling off edith's face. rick's expression brightens into a false smile. 
rick: wow, edith. that was a great play. i really fell for it. 
edith: oh, you. i just got lucky. 
rick: don't sell yourself short, sister. and you said you never played before? never. edith 
rick: i wonder why that is, considering what boundless potential you have for the game. edith smiles, but there's a nervous tension in her face. the dealer places the first card in the center. card alien four of diamonds! edith scans the various aliens around the table and hears their thoughts 
aliens  (v. o.) : aw man... at least i got a pair... are you kidding me... i'm never going to find happiness... she reaches rick. 
rick  (v. o.) : hold out for the flush, rick. you can do this... time passes. chips are tossed in. cards are dealt. rick laughs and acts cocky through it all, annoying the hell out of the other players. yeah baby! keep those diamonds coming! the dealer places the fifth and final card in the center of the table. 
card alien: queen of diamonds! rick slaps his face and pulls his cheeks in annoyance. 
rick: are you serious. this is total bullshit. did you really shuffle those cards? edith stares at rick and hears his thoughts. 
rick  (v. o.) : yeah motherfucker! whoo hoo! victory lap, baby! rick shrugs and tosses in the remainder of his chips. 
rick: screw it. might as well go all in, right? the remaining players look to edith to see how she will play. she and rick stare-down until she shakes her head and pushes her cards forward. i fold. 
edith: the rest of the players fold as well. 
dealer: pot goes to the man in white! rick laughs hysterically as he pulls in the giant pile of chips. 
rick: i knew it! you thought i had diamonds! rick pokes his two card aliens over and over. 
card aliens: (giggling) two of clubs! eight of spades! two of clubs! eight of spades! edith's brow furrows in anger, but she manages to force a smile. 
edith: that was a fine bluff you pulled, son. 
rick: hey, i can't take all the credit. i couldn't do it without you. 
edith: i'm sorry? i don't follow. rick walks over to edith's side of the table. get away from me--rick rips off the tentacles from her face, revealing her true appearance. the aliens around the table gasp. 
rick: i present a pessnion mind-reader from the triangulum quadrant! the other players'shock turns to anger. you thought you were reading my mind? even i can't read my own mind. rick grabs his pile of coins, flips one to the dealer and another to edith, then leaves the table. edith glares at rick as he walks away. she pulls out a walkie-talkie. 
casino - bar: edith's husband takes a long sip from his drink when edith's voice comes through the walkie-talkie in his pocket. 
edith  (v. o.) : the jig is up! get that human bastard! the husband scans the casino----and spots rick walking towards the cash exchange. 
husband: children! attack! the toddlers rip the tentacles off their faces and chase after rick. 
casino: rick heads for the cash exchange, whistling with joy, oblivious to the mayhem the toddlers are creating as they run towards him. rick sees another alien in front of him react. rick looks back----the toddlers knock past an alien in their way, just a few meters away from rick. oh shit! 
rick: rick sprints towards the cash exchange. 
casino - craps table: an alien tosses the alien dice. snake eyes. the alien groans when----rick appears and throws the table to the ground. the dice fall and bounce until they stop, turning the snake eyes into a 7 roll. the alien cheers. but his glee is short-lived as the toddlers leap over the table, kicking the alien in the face as they go past. 
toddler 1: delta formation! the other toddlers run ahead, then stop and hold each others hands. toddler 1 sprints forward. leaps onto the hands of the other two, who throw toddler 1 towards rick. rick looks back and sees the toddler soaring through the air at him. he glances to his side. rips a roulette wheel off a table. swings it against the toddler as if he were a baseball. the toddler goes flying into the aqueous body of another alien and gets stuck inside. home run! 
rick: rick turns, nearly home free, when----edith knocks into him from the side. rick goes sprawling. his chips fly out onto the casino floor. rick and edith both stare as aliens that look strangely like pigeons appear and peck at the chips, taking them, and flying away. damn it! edith listens to rick's thoughts. 
rick  (v. o.) : i'm going to punch her in the face. rick throws a punch at edith's face, but she dodges and punches him in the gut. 
rick: stop reading my mind! edith reaches behind her and pulls out a gun. holy shit! you brought a gun? edith points the gun at rick's face, but he knocks it out of her hands. he then raises his hands up to edith's neck. 
rick  (v. o.) : i'm going to choke you. i'm going to choke you. i'm going to choke you. edith backs away to avoid being choked. instead, rick kicks edith between her legs. she screams in pain. rick pushes her off him. 
rick: haha! you fell for it again! rick dives for edith's gun. then points it at her. edith's family arrives on scene. hey hey hey. back away or i shoot. the family slowly steps backwards. 
across the casino: a security guard spots rick holding the gun on the family. 
security guard: not on my watch. he jumps into action. 
back on rick: rick gestures with the gun. 
rick: now take out your wallets and toss them over here. the family complies. rick grabs the wallets, still keeping the gun held on them. good. now get on the ground and pretend that you're, i don't know... worms. yeah, that'll work. (off their reactions) do it! the family gets on the ground, then start undulating like worms. rick chuckles to himself then backs away and slips through the door morty was taken away into. moments later, a squad of security guards barrel through the door, chasing after rick. casino underground-cage 
[int. casino - underground - cage - night] 
the girl and morty get thrown into the cage. they look at each other and laugh. 
morty: wow, that was probably the most fun i've had in my life. me too. 
girl: they face each other. their eyes filled to the brim with love. the girl sets her hand on morty's and leans in. morty, closes his eyes, puckers his lips. they almost kiss when----bang! an explosion! morty looks over to find rick sprinting down the stairs, shooting back at security guards. rick? morty 
girl: is that your grandfather? morty runs up to the cage wall. 
morty: rick! rick!!! over here! rick spots morty. he shoots several robed aliens as he makes his way to the cage. rick, thank god you're here! rick shoots the lock on the cage. the children all rush out. 
rick: c'mon, morty. there's no time to waste. morty takes the girl's hand. 
morty: come with us. 
girl: i don't know... 
rick: oh god, please tell me you're not bringing some alien penis virus back. 
morty: (ignoring rick) we can help you find your parents. you just need to get out of this hell hole. the girl considers morty's proposition. finally, she nods. okay. 
girl: she takes morty's hand and they run through the labor camp together. rick shoots two robed aliens. he looks back to find a group of security guards hot on their tail. rick spots a pulley system nearby. morty! 
rick: morty realizes what rick is up to and takes the girl over to the pulley system. rick covers them by shooting at the security guards. rick catches up. he grabs a crane that is connected to the pulley. hold on tight! (morty grabs rick's legs while gripping the girl's hand tightly.) (he shoots the dashboard, sending them flying up as the pulley carries them high into the sky.) (the abandoned children all stare up at the trio as they scream at the top of their lungs.) (the pulley carries them all the way back to the steps that descend into the underground camp. they hop off and make their way up the stairs.) (they are nearly free when the girl shrieks. rick and morty look back to find a security guard has grabbed the girl's ankle.) 
morty: no!!! (morty snatches the gun from rick's hands and aims at the guard. but a laser hits the gun, knocking it out of morty's hands.) (rick looks down to see a security guard aiming a gun at them.) 
rick: morty, we need to get out of here! morty reaches for the girl's outstretched hand, but oncoming laser-fire forces rick to pick morty up and carry him up the stairs. 
morty: no! stop, rick! morty gropes the air, trying in vain to reach the girl, but he stops when he sees her with a sad smile. go. 
girl: he stares in shock as rick carries him away. 
casino - corridor: rick bursts through the opening that he blast through earlier. 
rick: damn it, morty. who goes into a labor camp and gains weight? morty stares back at the opening to the underground camp, defeated. 
[int. jerry and beth's bedroom - night] 
beth and jerry sleep in bed. we push into jerry's face until we enter... 
[int. living room - day - jerry's dreams] 
jerry presses the button. the wall opens up and a tray holding a steaming stack of pancakes, cut in the shape of 
beth. : the entire family pops in yelling suprise!!! 
family: beth kisses jerry. 
beth: happy anniversary, jerry. she pushes jerry onto the couch and they make love. rick, morty, and summer skip around them, throwing confetti. 
[int. jerry and beth's bedroom - night] 
a creepy smile appears on jerry's face. we push in again... 
[int. living room - day - jerry's dreams] 
jerry presses the button. a giant laser emerges from the wall and zaps jerry, turning him into a pile of steaming ash. rick pops in from the kitchen. 
rick: haha! joke's on you, jerry! the family enters. beth is holding davin's arm. 
beth: i'm so glad we got rid of him. now i don't have to hide davin. she and davin make out furiously. rick, morty, and summer skip around them, throwing confetti. 
morty: i'm so glad davin's our new dad! 
[int. jerry and beth's bedroom - night] 
jerry's face contorts with discomfort. his eyes open and he sits up. he looks down at beth, with an apologetic look. 
jerry: i'm sorry, beth. i have to know. 
living room: jerry sneaks into the dark living room. the only source of light is from the moon. jerry pulls the bookshelf from the wall. he sees the button and a smile creeps onto his face. he goes to press it when----the lights turn on! shocked, jerry jumps away. he looks around and sees beth sitting on the couch. 
jerry: beth! what, what are you doing up? 
beth: i've been down here all night, jerry. 
jerry: but you were in bed... was i? beth 
jerry and beth's bedroom: a life-size beth doll falls out of the bed. 
living room: jerry looks defeated. 
jerry: not again... you told me you would never use her against me! 
beth: i also told you to ignore the damn button. they standoff for a beat. jerry breaks down. he crumples into a ball, sobbing. 
jerry: i'm sorry! i'm so sorry! i couldn't help myself. i have to know! a door opens upstairs. 
summer  (o. s.) : what's all this noise! i'm trying to sleep! summer enters the living room to find her father in the fetal position, tears streaming down his face. she doesn't even take a second before turning around and leaving the situation alone. beth's expression softens. she kneels next to jerry and sets her hand on his shoulder. 
beth: i'm sorry too. i should have known the mystery would be too much for you. 
jerry: (brightens) so it is pancakes? 
beth: what? no. i have no idea. i just meant that it's okay to be curious. but we can't risk it. we don't know what my father could have done. jerry processes beth's words. then nods. they hug. 
[int. casino - night] 
the security guards search the casino for rick and morty. 
security guard: scan the area! they spread out. 
casino - bar: edith and her family lick their wounds at the bar. edith downs a drink in one go. 
edith: that meddling human! if i see him again i'll crush his ass. 
husband: now honey, slow down with the drinks-- 
edith: shut up you stupid son of a whore! you're only here to sell the act. edith calls for the bartender when she sees rick and morty poke their heads out of a tropical plant. an opportunistic grin grows on her face. 
casino: close in on rick and morty. rick scans the area. 
tropical plant: do you mind? they look down and see that the tropical plant is actually an alien. 
rick: shut your mouth or else i'll force-feed you weedkiller. rick scans the casino and finds the path to the exit is clear. come on, morty. they jump out. sneak through the crowd of aliens. the guards search for them in vain. rick and morty hide behind a roulette table. rick pokes his head out to see that the guard's head is turned. they make a run for it when----edith tackles rick from behind. her fists pound on his face. 
edith: give me back my money! 
rick: damn it! morty, help me out here! morty stares in horror. he goes to help, but edith snarls at him. morty backs away. he desperately searches for something to help rick, when he notices a ventilation shaft. morty leaps into action. he jumps across the heads of several aliens, getting higher and higher until he jumps up----grabs a vent. he wrenches it open. a security guard in the distance sees the commotion around rick and edith as well as morty hanging from the vent. morty sticks his arm into the ventilation shaft. groping around desperately. morty, can you hurry up! i'm getting my ass beat by a sixty year old woman here! morty struggles. he can't find what he's looking for. get him! 
security guard  (o. s.) : morty looks down to see the security guards have gathered beneath him. they beat his legs with night sticks. morty bites his lip in pain, until finally----his fingers find the sponge. morty drops like a lead weight. his body squishes on top of the sponge and a green gas squeezes out. the gas passes over morty and he hears a distinct laughter. it's the girl. soon, he starts to giggle. then, everybody else joins in. as the gas spreads through the casino, aliens start to laugh. the gas continues to travel all throughout the casino until everybody is rolling on the floor in laughter. the security guards are incapacitated, trying to find space to breathe between laughing fits. morty giggles as he crawls on the floor to rick. 
rick: (laughing) good job, morty. let's get out of here. they struggle to get to their feet. edith cackling like a witch, grabs rick's foot. rick kicks her in the face, she lets go, still laughing as if she felt nothing. rick and morty help each other to the exit, struggling to breathe. 
[ext. casino - night] 
rick and morty fall out of the casino. the effects of the gas still working. 
rick: we need to find something to get off this planet. they look around and find a store with a sign that reads space bikes for rent. they laugh their asses off. irony, right? such a bitch. 
[ext. goruscant - space] 
rick and morty pedal away from goruscant on a tandem bike. morty looks back, laughing but his eyes are sad. 
morty: i never even got to learn her name... 
rick: geez, morty. you'll meet other girls, and they'll also have names, which maybe you'll take the time to learn! as they ride away, the gas begins to wear off. their laughter dies and morty's quiet sobs replace them. but seriously, that's a no on the alien penis virus, right? 
[int. living room - day] 
jerry sits on the couch, watching tv. beth pokes her head in the room. 
beth: summer and i are going to the mall. do you want anything? i'm good. jerry 
beth: are you going to be okay alone? 
jerry: geez, beth. have some faith in your husband. 
beth: okay... we'll be back soon then. jerry listens closely as beth and summer close the door behind them. he dashes to the window and sees them drive off. once they are out of sight, he runs to the bookshelf. he pulls it out and stares at the button. 
jerry: i'm sorry, honey... jerry looks away and shuts his eyes. his finger hovers over the button... 
[int. police station - day] 
rick and morty follow an anthropomorphic pig that is dressed as a police officer. 
morty: geez, rick. you really weren't lying about the space police. 
rick: i never lie, morty. not when it's about pigs. the officer glares back at them as he opens a door leading to a garage filled with hundreds of ships. he takes them to where rick's ship has been parked. thanks, asshole. rick hands the officer edith's family's wallets. 
officer: no, thank you. 
[int. living room - day] 
jerry finally presses the button, a frightened expression on his face. but nothing happens. he presses the button again, to no avail. 
[int. police station - day] 
rick: at least we can finally head home. as rick goes to climb in, the ship disappears. 
[int. smith home - garage - day] 
rick's ship materializes in the garage. 
[int. living room - day] 
jerry shakes his head. 
jerry: pft. nice prank, rick, but you can't pull the wool over my eyes. jerry returns to the couch with a satisfied smile. 
[int. police station - day] 
rick sighs in defeat. 
rick: c'mon, morty. we're biking back. 
[int. rick’s spacecraft] 
rick and morty whiz through the starscape. 
morty: slow down! why are you going so fast? 
rick: trust me, morty. this part of the universe is not for sightseeing. rick cranks the wheel hard. the ship careens toward a little grey planet, dagobah. 
city sidewalk - day: on this planet everybody is a gangster. fedoras, pinstripe suits, and violin cases. even the moms and kids. rick lands on the sidewalk. they get out. morty is scared. 
morty: i don t like this. 
rick: you ll be fine. no smiling. morty immediately adopts a menacing scowl. 
morty: what are we even doing here? 
rick: i need a flaxenator for the time machine. 
morty: don t you already have one? 
rick: not since summer used it as a curling iron, i don t. 
morty: can t you just go to the regular place? 
rick: the regular place was shut down by the galactic federation. it s black market or nothing from now on. try not to get stabbed. they walk into a-- 
[int. pet store - continuous] 
colorful birds in cages squawk. funky multi-headed reptiles sun themselves in terrariums. notably, there is a large chimpanzee in a cage at the end of an aisle. he stands gripping the bars. gives morty his thousand-yard stare... 
chimpanzee s face: extreme close-up of his eyes. within the eyes, we see colorful nebulae, star fields, and a black hole devouring a star. 
back: morty is mesmerized. his eyes turn into little tilt-a-whirl bull's-eye cones. he shakes his head and blinks. barely escapes the spell. tugs rick s jacket. 
morty: uh, rick... rick ignores him. he s talking to the pet shop clerk, an 80-year-old geezer in a too-big pinstriped suit and fedora. 
rick: i heard you have some time machine parts. 
pet shop clerk: i don t know what you mean. we run a clean shop here. 
rick: cut the crap old man. i don t have time for your games. just show me what you got so we can get out of here. the clerk looks over rick s shoulder at the chimp. the chimp nods his assent. the clerk s eyes turn into hypno-cones too. the clerk flips the door sign to closed . he leads rick and morty to a doorway. opens the door, pulls the light chain. click. 
[int. pet store basement - continuous] 
they tromp down the stairs. a long table is covered with multiple ‘gizmos’ and ‘whatsits’. rick is thrilled. grabs a box and starts tossing items in. morty notices dozens of handcuffs hanging off the walls. 
morty: uh, sir? why does your pet shop basement have so many handcuffs? 
rick: don t be rude, morty. 
pet shop clerk: (robotically) bird seed is on special this week. morty looks at him suspiciously. 
pet shop clerk: you should take home a few pounds. 
morty: something s wrong rick. rick is still shopping. finally finds the flaxenator. it is a long green tube in the shape of a curling iron. he holds it up triumphantly. 
rick: yes! the lights go out. pitch black. 
morty  (o. s.) : rick! sounds of fighting! boom! bang! crash! boxes tumble. furniture breaks. bodies struggle. 
rick  (o. s.) : hang on, morty! the room is bathed in an ethereal green glow. morty has found the flaxenator and turned it on. rick wrestles with the chimp! sweating and straining, rick gets him in a headlock. pins him down! 4. 
rick: huh? you like that you piece of shit? huh! rick twists his neck. snap! the chimp goes limp. dead. 
rick: hypno-chimp. the universe is filled with these little bastards. bet you thought he was cute didn t you. 
morty: i, uh-- 
rick: that s how they get you. main titles start 
pet store - day: rick and morty are talking with the clerk upstairs. 
pet shop clerk: i can t thank you enough for murdering mister crackers like that. 
rick: technically it was self-defense. i m not sure it fits the legal definition-- 
pet shop clerk: ever since he arrived, i ve been behaving most oddly. 
rick: oh yeah? odd enough to knock a few flurbos off this box of junk? 
pet shop clerk: of course! of course! special prices just for you. but i was thinking of something else. perhaps for the boy... morty is looking at puppies in cages. they re adorable. spastic wagging and panting. 
morty: yeah? can i get one? 5. 
rick: no way! 
morty: why not? 
rick: because he probably has fleas. or flurms. 
morty: what are flurms? 
rick: they re a lot like fleas, except they, you know, kill you. he takes a swig from his flask. 
morty: oh, no mister rick! none of that here. these animals are all guaranteed healthy. purely bred from champion stock. go ahead young man. pick one out for yourself. morty opens a cage and takes out a black and white puppy. the dog licks his face. morty cradles him. 
rick: great. 
pet shop clerk: he ll be a lovely addition to your family. 
[ext. pet store - later] 
rick and morty are walking back to the spaceship. rick is carrying his box. morty is leading the dog on a leash. 
morty: thanks rick. 
rick: let me tell you something, dog ever chews up anything to me, he goes right back. mean to the store. you got morty. if that that belongs and i don t me? pull back to reveal the puppy is in the spaceship. the seats are totally chewed to shreds. stuffing flies! 6. 
rick s spacecraft - later: rick and morty drive home, sitting on destroyed upholstery. morty has a different puppy in his lap. this one is brown and white. 
morty: lucky he had another one, right? 
rick: yeah, real lucky. they speed away. 
[int. smith home, living room - day] 
summer is laying on the couch listening to earbuds. she has a bandage on her head and some of her hair is burned, presumably where the flaxenator exploded. jerry and beth enter, mid-argument. 
beth: what is the big deal, jerry? 
jerry: the big deal is that if you re not going to finish you might as well not even start! 
beth: my shoulder was tired, okay? if you worked for a living then maybe you d have a little more understanding of what that s like. 
summer: i can totally hear you. jerry ignores her. 
jerry: but stopping in the middle can cause real damage. permanent damage! to my... you know. 
summer: you really have no idea of boundaries, do you? 
beth: there! see what you ve done? you ve upset our daughter. 7. 
jerry: hi, honey. your mother and i were just having a discussion about what happens when you don t-- (clenched teeth) follow through on your commitments. 
beth: jerry! 
jerry: what? she has to learn sometime. you obviously never did. rick and morty enter. morty is leading the dog on a leash. 
beth: you got a dog! summer looks over the couch. sees the dog. rolls her eyes. plops back down. 
morty: uh, rick? he seems a lot older now. (and he s right. the dog is fully-grown now.) 
rick: oh, yeah? i must ve forgotten to account for his mass through the worm hole. at least his flurms are dead. 
jerry: what are flurms? 
rick: don t worry about it, jerry. 
beth: he s beautiful. (this is also true. the dog has a noble bearing, and almost sensual good looks.) 
jerry: great! i can just see it now. i m going to get stuck feeding him, walking him, and paying the vet bills. not to mention cleaning up after him and walking around the neighborhood carrying his poo in a little plastic bag. let me tell you, there is no way to keep your dignity in that situation! none! 8. 
rick: that ship has sailed jerry. 
jerry: and then one day, you come home from school and he s just gone. (he gets a little weepy) and so you ask your parents, did you send him to the doggie retirement farm upstate? and they just say, no, he s dead . (sniffle, sniffle) and when you start to cry your parents make fun of you. they call you little baby jerry diaper face. and you try to keep it inside but it hurts so bad you just can t! so you start to imagine what they d look like if they were dead-- 
beth: jerry! 
jerry: i m through apologizing for my feelings! he runs off blubbering. 
rick: i m going to the garage. i have to order new seats. he walks off sipping from his flask. 
beth: (to morty) does he have a name? 
morty: not yet. what else is brown and white? 
summer: your nose? 
beth: summer! 
summer: your underwear? 
beth: can t you be nice for once? 9. 
summer: let me remind you, mother, that last month i asked for a kitten and my request was scorned. 
beth: scorned? 
summer: yes, scorned! but as soon as morty finds a dog who-knows-where, we throw out the welcome mat! the dog now has his leg hiked over his head. licking his balls. 
morty: how about sniffy? or, uhh, licky? beth is fixated on the ball-licking. extreme close-up on the tongue in slow motion. lick. slower. liiiiick. even slower. liiiiiiiiiiick. 
beth: (trance-like) how about maximilian? the dog snaps his head around when he hears the name. leg still over his head. tongue still hanging out. locks eyes with beth. beth s eyes. the dog s eyes. even closer. beth... the dog. until beth is magically transported away to-- 
[ext. saharan oasis - night] 
palm trees sway in the night breeze. a placid pond reflects the full-moon and twinkling stars. beth and the dog, maximilian, are seated at a table covered with platters of food and wine bottles. veiled servant girls in belly-dancer outfits wait on them. beth’s hair, makeup, and gown are all date-night extreme. maximilian wears a bow-tie. 
beth: i never knew it could be like this. she looks at him shyly. 
maximilian: nor i. maximilian has a new zealand accent, very similar to jemaine clement. he gently lays his paw over her hand. stares at her. 
beth: it s just so... so... powerful between us. 
maximilian: i have felt it too. 
beth: it scares me... a little. 
maximilian: i would never hurt you. 
beth: we know this can t last. 
maximilian: we have the night. he waves his arm, presenting the scenery to her. 
maximilian: in this place. in this time. 
beth: i should get home. it s been too long. 
maximilian: please stay with me. beth peeks at him. stares down suddenly. peeks up again. 
[int. bedouin tent - later] 
(a torch burns. servant girls wave palm fronds. beth is on her back deep in a cozy melange of brightly-colored pillows. her gown and shoes on the sandy floor.)
(beth's parts are strategically obscured by pillows. we only see her head, shoulders, and knees.)
(maximilian is crouched between her legs. he tugs his bow-tie. it unties. he leaves it jaunty and loose around his neck. his head gets lower... and lower. out of frame.)
(close-up on beth. squinting eyes. curling toes. a full-screen close-up of the dog s tongue. it flits wildly in empty space. whipsawing back and forth like a snake when you step on its tail.)
[int. smith home, living room - later] 
beth is staring slack-jawed at the dog who is now humping her leg with abandon. 
morty: i think he likes it. 
summer: something s wrong! 
morty: mom? beth rouses herself. shakes her head. blink, blink. pushes the dog off. she struggles to remain calm. 
beth: excuse me. she backs away slowly. turns. runs up the stairs. 
[int. smith home, master bedroom - later] 
summer is standing in her parents’ bedroom. she stares at the bathroom door. shower sounds. steam drifts out under the door. summer knocks. 
summer: mom? no response. 
summer: mom! you ve been in there for over an hour. (knock, knock) you re using all the hot water! (beat) mom? 
[int. smith home, living room - day’s later] 
morty and summer are playing a video game. dad is reading a newspaper nearby. morty is really going at it. tongue sticking out of the corner of his mouth, eyes hyper-alert, fingers flying over the controller. close-up on the-- 
video game screen: it s a girlie-type game called mallstars . lots of pink shopping bags, shoe stores, and glitter. morty is furiously guiding his character through the mall. back 
summer: you just missed a thirty-percent off sale. get the sandals. the sandals! 
morty: i m getting them! 
summer: ick! you call that an outfit? 
video game screen: the screen flashes, ugly outfit , as morty s score turns red and starts reversing. 
morty: bleepity, bleep, bleep, bleeper. jerry looks up from his paper. 
jerry: let s watch that language, son. while morty continues to play, maximilian walks into the room. sits regally, with a red ball in his mouth. he drops the ball and it rolls toward morty. morty kicks it back. 
morty: not now, max. i m busy. the dog nudges the ball back toward morty. whimpers a little. 
morty: i said get out of here! 
jerry: hey, come on now! he wants to play. why don t you take max outside for a nice game of fetch? 
morty: (still playing) uhh, no thanks. you take him if you want. 
jerry: i can t believe it. since when does a boy not want to play with his dog? 
summer: he s super-creepy dad. 
morty: yep. 
jerry: creepy? what are you talking about? 
summer: he waits for me outside the bathroom. not just once or twice, either. i mean every single day! max blinks his eyes a few times. pants. 
video game voice  (o. s.) : you have worn the same shoes three times this month. your game is over. 
morty: you made me lose! 
summer: your taste in thigh-high boots made you lose. 
morty: it did not! they looked fine! 
jerry: great! perfect time to take max out. and i don t want any backtalk young man. 
morty: alright. come on. 
[ext. city park - later] 
morty is wearing a fall jacket and leading max by some park benches. morty takes the red ball. tosses it. it barely rolls a couple of yards. max dutifully grabs it. trots back triumphantly. wags. morty sits on a bench. throws the ball again. doesn’t even look where it goes. takes out his phone. starts thumb-clicking. max brings back the ball again. whimpers a little. but morty is now totally absorbed in something. bark! bark! deep, menacing barks. morty looks up, startled. 
morty: what! what do you want you stupid dog? but the dog has his eyes locked on morty s eyes. morty falls into a hypnotic stupor. back and forth on the eyes. just like with beth. until we re transported to-- 
[int. criminal courtroom - day] 
typical. lots of dark wood. a judge on a high dais. everybody in attendance is a dog. the lawyers, the jury, the onlookers, everybody. morty is in the witness box. he looks around in alarm. 
morty: what s going on here? 
judge: silence! maximilian is the prosecutor. he stands (on his hind legs) nonchalantly in front of a heavy wooden table. he s wearing a suit coat and a tie. a pair on pince-nez spectacles are perched on his nose. he carries a rolled-up newspaper. 
maximilian: i ll ask the questions here! he still sounds exactly like jemaine clement. oooh s and ahhh s from the crowd. he strides forward. very wobbly on his hind legs. reaches the witness box. leans his elbow on it. trying to act all cool like a dick prosecutor would. he taps the newspaper on his opposite paw a few times. 
maximilian: you don t like me very much, do you? 
morty: oh, i, umm--morty s lawyer is a feminine white persian cat, in a vest. 
cat: objection! immaterial! 
judge: overruled! 
cat: i request a moment to confer with my client your honor. 
judge: denied! the dogs in the crowd start barking like maniacs. some lean over the rail and start crowding the cat. she stands up on the table. the horde inches forward. growling. she stands her ground. then she raises both arms and flips them her middle fingers. but her paws are tiny so they barely stick up half an inch. that s it. the dogs attack! we only see morty s reaction. he s repulsed. looks away. his defense table is covered in a blood stain and shreds of white fur. 
judge: order! i will have order in the court! 
maximilian: do you know why you re here today? 
morty: not exactly. 
maximilian: have i been a good dog? 
morty: you re okay, i guess. 
maximilian: strike as nonresponsive. 
judge: sustained. maximilian glares at him. 
maximilian: have i been a good dog? 
morty: (rethinks) yes! yes, you ve been a great dog. 
maximilian: uh, huh. so i ll ask again. why are we here today? 
morty: i don t know. i ve never been in dog court before. max slaps morty on the nose with the paper. thwap! 
morty: ow! hey! 
judge: i m warning you. if you continue to try the patience of this court you will be held in contempt! 
maximilian: the defendant stands accused of the high crime of ignoring! max leans on the jury box railing for full effect. 
maximilian: and the punishment is death! end of act i 
[int. smith home, kitchen - day] 
jerry enters. sweaty, like he’s been working in the yard. sings new lyrics to “here we go round the mulberry bush.” 
jerry: this is the way we mow the lawn, mow the lawn, mow the lawn. grabs a loaf of bread. opens a cupboard. 
jerry: this is the way we make a sandwich, make a sandwich, make a sandwich. the cupboard is filled with several rows of the same jar. we can t read the label until, 
jerry: (stops singing) beth sure has been buying a lot of peanut butter lately. he gets a suspicious look. 
jerry: i thought she was allergic to peanuts. 
[int. criminal courtroom - day] 
morty is still on the witness stand. he’s sweaty and nervous. maximilian is pacing back and forth. he’s a little disheveled too. his tie is loose. 
maximilian: that brings us to dinner on the fourth. do you remember what happened on the fourth? 
morty: not really. max dramatically directs his speech to the jury. 
maximilian: you gave me broccoli under the table! gasps of surprise from the audience. 
morty: yeah! see, i gave you something. that proves i wasn t ignoring you. doesn t it? max whirls on morty. 
maximilian: i hate broccoli! everybody in this room hates broccoli! 
morty: how should i know? you ate it. you ate it all. 
maximilian: yes. yes, i did. and do you know why? 
morty: antioxidants? 
maximilian: no. i did it for you. some members of the jury wipe away tears. 
maximilian: so you wouldn t get into trouble. 
morty: oh, wow. i guess you really did something nice for me there. really took one for the team. 
maximilian: plus, your mother made it. morty looks askance. 
morty: what s going on between you and my mom, man? it s really weird. 
maximilian: silence! you are not fit to speak her name. 
[int. smith home, master bedroom - day] 
jerry slinks in. beth is asleep. the covers are a tangled mess. there is an empty wine bottle on the nightstand. 
jerry: honey? beth rouses herself. still groggy. 
beth: what time is it? 
jerry: i m worried about something... she peeks at the clock. 
beth: oh my god! it s three in the afternoon! jerry waves an empty peanut butter jar at her. 
jerry: care to tell me about your new-found love? beth stammers. 
beth: i, uh... jerry. i m sorry. i don t know what s wrong with me. i tried it one time and it sort of got out of hand... 
jerry: that s very dangerous. 
beth: i know. it was stupid. it was so powerful i just couldn t resist. 
jerry: i play around myself once in awhile. but i always come back to the old standbys. the ones that remind me of mom. is that what happened? beth is bewildered. 
beth: uhh... not exactly. 
jerry: but i thought you were allergic to peanuts. 
beth: peanuts? that s what this is about? 
jerry: of course. i m worried about you. 
[int. criminal courtroom - day] 
morty stands in front of the judge’s dais. he points at morty with his gavel. 
judge: you have been found guilty of the high crime of ignoring . i hereby decree that you be taken to the place of execution where you will never again be allowed to rub your butt on the carpet. some security guard (dogs) grab morty and start dragging him away as max looks on smugly. morty struggles. 
morty: hey! you can t do this. i want to appeal. you ate my lawyer! 
maximilian: take him away! 
[ext. city park - day] 
morty is sound asleep on the bench. drools like rick. max stares at him. morty rouses. sees max. 
morty: oh, hey there boy. that sure was a crazy dream. 
maximilian: it was no dream morty. morty is a little freaked to hear max talking. 
morty: it wasn t? 
maximilian: and you know what i must do. 
morty: think so, huh? he picks up the red ball and throws it. max just stares. morty is disappointed his escape plan failed. 
maximilian: i am immune to the powers of the red ball. 
morty: oh yeah? he runs for his life through the park! benches, baby strollers, and trees are blurry streaks as he passes. max is hot on his heels. a growling, snarling menace. morty runs into the-- 
woods: leaps over a fallen log. keeps running. turns around. doesn t see max. stops in a-- 
[ext. woodland clearing - continuous] 
morty is panting, sweaty, and scared. there is an old- fashioned well nearby. stone circle and a bucket crank. morty leans on it. turns to the right. listens for max. distant echoing barks. morty turns left. even more distant barks. morty hesitates. then max enters the clearing. low and stealthy, like a wolf. ears pinned. hackles raised. growling. morty backs against the well. 
morty: look, i m really sorry about this. i guess i should have paid more attention to you. 
maximilian: too late for that. morty tries to dart away. max heads him off. bark! bark! 
maximilian: in you go. 
later: morty is hanging by his fingertips inside the well. below him is a black abyss. max stands on his hind legs. looking in. taunting him. 
morty: i take back what i said. you re not a good dog at all. you re a bad dog! a very, very bad dog! 
maximilian: i m sorry it s come to this morty. but it s out of my paws. there s nothing i can do. he plucks morty s fingers off the edge one at a time. plink! plink! 
maximilian: now i m sleeping on the bed. morty falls! disappears in the blackness. 
[int. smith home, garage] 
the spaceship now has zebra print seats. rick has his laptop open and he’s talking through an earpiece. 
rick: no! you made the mistake. i never said i wanted the zebra print. i m a renegade, not a pimp! (beat) three weeks! are you (bleeping) kidding me! (beat) look pal, i am personally coming down there today and kicking your zebra print ass--jerry enters. 
jerry: rick? i m worried about beth. 
rick: if you want to worry about something, you should worry about this salesman s health. (into phone) no! do not put me on hold. damn it! 
jerry: didn t she have allergies as a kid? 
rick: how should i know? i wasn t exactly an engaged parent. whatever problems she has i mostly just blame on you. 
jerry: because anaphylactic shock is a risky thing. 
rick: i have to run an errand. where s morty? 
jerry: i haven t seen him since this morning. maximilian walks into the garage. sits. pants. stares. 
jerry: he took max for a walk... they both look suspiciously at max. max narrows his eyes. tries to put rick in a trance. 
[int. nursing home - day] 
max is caring for rick in an old age home. rick is in a wheelchair. shriveled and wrinkly. barely has the strength to hold his head up. max has a little grey in the muzzle too. max is spoon-feeding him from a soup bowl. 
maximilian: there you go. all gone. he wipes rick s mouth with a bib. 
maximilian: time for your pills. max puts one pill in a cup. rick grunts. 
rick: uggguh. max is surprised. looks at him. 
maximilian: the pain is bad? you need two? max puts another pill in the cup. 
rick: uggguh! 
maximilian: you know what the doctor said. it s too dangerous. 
rick: uggguh! 
maximilian: i understand you my old friend. you need your sun to set, yes? rick has a tiny tear in his eye. max brings the entire bottle of pills to him. closes his hand around it. max lays his head on rick s chest. whimpers a little. 
[ext. grassy meadow - later] 
rick and max are distant black silhouettes against a glorious orange sunset. then rick takes out his blaster and shoots max in the head. blammo! 
[int. smith home, garage - continuous] 
rick is pointing his blaster at max. 
rick: you little bastard! 
jerry: what are you doing? we love max. max just sits there. stupid dog face. pant. pant. 
rick: hypno-pup! i didn t even know they existed. must have learned it from that damn monkey. where s morty! 
jerry: morty? you think he hurt him? 
rick: he s the only one who came home. he must know something. jerry grabs max by his chest fur (like it s a shirt). hauls the dog off the ground. eyeball to eyeball. 
jerry: what did you do with my son! 
garage - later: max is chained to a wall in a standing position. rick places a mind-reading device on his head. it looks like a pasta strainer with a bunch of wires and bulb attachments. beth walks in. 
beth: what are you doing to max? 
jerry: morty s missing. 
beth: missing? 
rick: my mind meld machine will get the truth out of him. he starts fiddling with some dials and buttons. checks a computer monitor. 
rick: yesiree! with this baby we ll be able to see everything he s done since he got here. beth goes wide-eyed with terror. slaps the pasta strainer off the dog s head. stomps it to pieces. 
jerry: what are you doing! rick understands immediately. 
rick: pull your head out of your ass, jerry! this dog has taken over your family and you didn t even notice! 
[int. smith home, upstairs hallway - day] 
summer creeps around the corner. looks both ways. doesn’t see max. 
summer: finally! she dashes into the bathroom and shuts the door. slam! 
[int. garage - continuous] 
rick: (to beth) have something you want to say? this ought to be good. 
beth: he hypnotized me, jerry. he s evil. 
jerry: into doing what, exactly? she gets a sick smile. 
beth:... different... things. jerry finally connects the dots. 
jerry: oh my god! 
beth: jerry, i m sorry. i was powerless! i couldn t help it! jerry looks over at max. still chained up. smug dog face. pant. pant. 
jerry: you! you son of a bitch! 
rick: interesting. he actually is a son of a bitch. jerry grabs rick s blaster. aims at max. 
rick: jerry, i know you re upset because your wife would rather have sex with animals instead of you. i get that. relationships are hard. 
beth: just this one time, dad! 
rick: yeah, but it was six months in dog years. and we don t know what the future holds. (to jerry) but if you pull that trigger our chances of finding morty are gone. jerry thinks. lowers the blaster. grabs max s chest fur again. 
jerry: for the last time, where s my son? max licks his face. 
beth: let me try. now, for the first time, beth turns the hypnotism trick around. she uses it on max. narrows her eyes. stares deeply at him, until we re-- 
[int. smith home, front doorway - night] 
max comes home after a long days work. loose necktie, ragged fur, exhausted expression. sets down a briefcase by the door. 
maximilian: i m home. beth enters. she s fat now. 
beth: where have you been! 
maximilian: busting my ass at the office. absolutely brutal! they re talking cutbacks! 
beth: have you been drinking? 
maximilian: phil and chad hit the bar after work. i had one beer. 
beth: sure you did. 
maximilian: what s with the attitude? i work damn hard supporting you and your brat kids. i can t have a (bleeping) beer now and then? 
beth: not when it means i m here alone all night, making dinner, helping with homework and everything else while you re out having a good time! 
maximilian: good time! listen, it s getting to the point where i need a couple of belts before coming home to face you! 
beth: oh, yeah? take a look in the mirror, pal! you re not looking so hot yourself these days. and another thing, i ve been telling you for three weeks to get the gutters cleaned, and you still haven t-- she trails off to a distant echo. then we re back to-- 
garage - continuous: beth is up in max s face. his eyes are little tilty cones. suddenly, he regains awareness. shakes off the spell. 
maximilian: alright! i give up. 
jerry: he talks? rick holds his blaster aimed at max. 
rick: he better start talking. 
[int. down the well - later] 
morty is standing in knee-deep water looking up at a tiny circle of fading blue daylight above. shivers. looks around nervously. yells up. 
morty: can anybody hear me? rick leans over the edge. looks down. sees morty. 
rick: don t worry morty. i m coming. morty is relieved. then beth leans over. 
beth: are you okay, sweetie? then summer leans over. 
summer: grandpa is getting rid of the dog. then jerry leans over. 
jerry: we re sending him to a ranch upstate. 
rick: yeah. a ranch upstate. close up on rick as he loads his blaster. end of act ii 
denoument. : in the tag, we re going back to page 25 when jerry was eyeball to eyeball with max. except we see it from a different angle. 
[ext. flurm gathering - day] 
we see thousands of tiny flurms on max. they are so microscopic that each individual hair of max’s brown and white fur is like a giant tree. they are insect-like creatures, except they carry crude weapons like spears and clubs, and wear primitively sewn leather garments. they are fond of piercings and tattoos. they are congregating in a vast horde that vanishes over the fur/tree horizon. hovering overhead is the hideously distorted face of jerry. 
[ext. flurm podium] 
the flurm chieftain addresses the crowd from a rough-hewn stage. 
flurm chief: attention flurms! the crowd quiets. 
flurm chief: the day of battle has come! the crowd chants in unison uggah-hoo! uggah-hoo! 
flurm chief: soon the great tormentor known only as jerry will be dead! euphoric chants. ullah-ullah-hoo! ullah-ullah-hoo! 
flurm chief: yes, he is giant! but his size is his weakness! our courage is great, and our hearts are pure! more rabid chanting. kill jerry! kill jerry! 
flurm chief: ready yourselves for glory! 
[ext. fur tips - continuous] 
the flurm horde begins climbing max’s fur. they shoot little arrows into jerry’s pores, which are the size of caves. they use the ropes to shinny across the chasm onto jerry’s face. 
[ext. jerry’s face - continuous] 
a flurm warrior takes out a knife and slashes jerry’s skin. straining with effort he pulls the flap of skin back. the rest of his platoon dives into the gash. 
flurm warrior: go! go! go! go! then he dives in. the gash falls closed. 
[ext. flurm podium - continuous] 
the chief stands watching his troops attack jerry. an attractive flurm female cradling an infant walks up behind him. 
flurm queen: our son will have his kingdom. 
flurm chief: let us pray. fade out. 
extraterrestrial news broadcast over bleak desert wastes. an over-the-top grizzled sci-fi trooper lays down suppressive fire. shouting and gunfire in the background. 
announcer  (v. o.) : we now return to our special report straight from cadupu the front line of the war on grubs with the interplanetary republic sentinels. the trooper turns to camera. 
nukington: grubs are crawling all over that collarium mine, soldier! are you a bad enough ass to take it back? 
morty  (o. c.) : the baddest of asses, sergeant major commander nukington sir! 
nukington: your mission is classified tier twelve ultra-dangerous. take this megaflamethrower. nukington holds up a ridiculously oversized flamethrower. 
nukington: and one more thing, morty. morty? for the love of (burp) christ, morty, will you take your eyes off the t-television? 
[int. morty’s home - living room - day] 
morty watches the tv, where nukington leads a screaming platoon over the top. rick snaps his fingers in front of morty’s face and he finally turns -- eyes bloodshot. 
morty: hey, rick. wanna cookie? 
rick: not now morty. we ve got a problem. 
morty: oh geez, rick, what is it? 
rick: my douchinon cells, morty. they re they re they re gone. like little brown (hic) robot turds, but they smell way worse. you know what i had to do for those suckers? horrible things, morty. no man should... rick notices morty s vacant stare. christ. you didn t get into my fulumpian hash browns, did you? 
morty:.. huh? 
rick: whew. just reefer. otherwise you d already have the horns. coming out of your ass cheeks. you don t have any ass horns, right? 
morty: fulumpian hash browns sound horrifying! 
rick: heh. y-you should see their (hic) eggs benedict. 
nukington  (o. c.) : here we go, ladies-slash-gentlemen! morty turns his attention back to the screen. 
rick: what is this junk, anyway? 
morty: it s alien news, rick! it s so much cooler than earth news. they ve got giant grub monster things and super badass explosions and-- 
nukington  (o. c.) : set your autoguns to maximum kill! news rots your brain, morty. never believe what you don t see with your own two eyes, morty. unless it s from me of course. lord knows you can t afford any-rot-any any more rottage. silence. morty s back on cadupu already. rick well, have a blast, kid. if you see the douchinon it s in a big silver bag. rick finishes off a bottle and exits. morty pulls a douchinon cell from the silver bag beside him and takes a bite as wefade out. end of cold open 
[int. morty’s home - living room - day] 
summer enters, texting. morty’s still watching tv and chomping down douchinon cells. she never once looks up. 
summer: mom! dad! i m home. silence. 
summer: as usual. she walks up behind morty. still typing. 
summer: oh my god. something smells literally like cat barf in here. morty doesn t look away. 
morty: check it out, summer, i found this crazy alien news channel. 
summer: (texting) wow, you re such a jerk. 
morty: c-come on, that s a little harsh. 
summer: not you, numbskull. dennis. he says i have a texting problem. what the hell does that even mean, i answer like instantly. ugh. no answer, only tinny gunfire. morty reaches for the bag. whatever. i m so over that. completely. hey, gimme a cookie. 
[int. kitchen - soon] 
beth and jerry argue the kitchen. she’s still in her scrubs. 
beth: well, maybe if we did more as a family they wouldn t be so attached to their toys. 
jerry: you know, i always paid attention to my father when he was in the room. 
beth: we re not going to beat our children, jerry. we ve been over this. 
jerry: what do you recommend, then, beth? another family drive-thru bonding experience? 
beth: it wouldn t have to be drive-thru all the time if you actually made dinner for once. 
jerry: oh. i see now. one minute it s oh my god, jerry, this salmon is raw, and the next it s why don t you make dinner more, jerry? guess what, i will. i ll pull one from the ol smith family cookbook. let me get my conductor s hat. jerry pulls out and dons an old chef s hat. 
jerry: all aboard. the dinner train is leaving the station. next stop meatloafsville. choo choo. jerry pantomimes pulling a train whistle. it s all beth can do not to facepalm. 
beth: just... don t poison us, jerry. 
[int. living room - later] 
summer and morty: both slumped in the couch, both stoned on douchinon cells, both in their own little worlds. summer mumbles and texts away. perez, a typical tough-chick soldier, yells at morty from the tv. 
perez: they re climbing through the vents! are you a bad enough ass to turn the thermostat all the way down? 
summer: (stoned, typing on phone) well then y-y-you can go to hell, dennis. it s not like i l-loved you or anything. loser. jerry walks in wearing his chef s hat and apron. 
jerry: hey, kids. guess what s on the menu tonight. 
morty: dead grub, sergeant! 
jerry: what? no, uh, meatloaf. jerry notices morty eating another douchinon cell. cookies? at four o clock? you re going to have no appetite if you keep eating like that, young man. 
beth  (o. c.) : let him enjoy his metabolism, jerry! he won t be thin forever. rick walks in, tugging out his hair. 
rick: jerry! listen, this is extremely-- 
jerry: not now, rick. i m conducting something called discipline. morty finishes off another douchinon cell. it slowly dons on rick what he s seeing. 
rick: uh huh, sure, go screw a aaaahh posideon s perineum, morty! rick snatches away the bag. only two cells remain. d-d-do you know what you re doing? there are intergalactic wars being fought over these! civilizations stamped out! planets bombed to glass! and you re j-j-just wolfing them down like (hic) famous amos! rick lifts morty off the couch and rushes him toward the workshop. 
jerry: wow. thank you, rick. i m actually impressed. 
[int. rick’s workshop - soon] 
rick holds morty by the shoulders and rants. 
rick: a really big problem, morty! without douchinon my whole operation goes tits up! laser gun, gone. spaceship, forgetaboudit. nipples pointed straight at the sky, morty! 
morty: i-i m really sorry about your robot poop, rick, but don t, you know, don t you think maybe a bag that says cookies is j-just a little misleading? 
rick: it s camouflage, morty. aliens hate cookies. rick drifts off in some old flashback. morty eyes the door. 
morty: look, the sentinels are about to charge the collarium mine and-- 
rick: hold up just a minute! collarium? 
morty: yeah. it s some kind of sort of space mineral thingy i guess. 
rick: this is perfect, morty! don t you see? when raised to a high enough temperature, collarium starts to (hic) pop and you get military grade douchinon! 
morty: so we get to adventure to cadupu? and meet the real sergeant major commander nukington and the nuker troopers?! 
rick: you do, morty. you re gonna go in there and grab that collarium. you re gonna grab it all up and bring it back here for me. rick grabs a speed-gun type device out of a junk pile and tries turning it on. he smacks the side. 
morty: i m really really not sure about this, rick. perez says there s a grub hivemind down there. 
rick: that s why it s gotta be you, morty. you ll be the world s smallest space cadet, that grub will never see you coming. 
morty: you think so? 
rick: i know it, kid. you ll be a hero. just take this chillometer. rick hands morty the device, it powers on. 
rick: collarium is one of the chillest elements in the universe. anything that chill is gonna light her like a chicago barn. 
morty: i dunno, rick, this is still ridiculously dangerous. c-can t i have a megaflamethrower or something? 
rick: y-know? sure. since you re such a whiner. rick stuffs his hand into a junk bin and pulls out a bluemetal box. 
rick: this here is a, uh, magno-shield. yeah. if anything happens, just press that little button and it ll make a big robot, no, genie, no, energy... point is, it ll protect you, morty. nothing can hurt you when you have this. he gives the magno-shield to morty and starts calibrating theportal gun. 
morty: gee, thanks rick. 
rick: sure, whatever. enough chitty-chat. let me just--rick meddles with the gun and accidentally shoots a portal at morty s feet. he falls through. 
morty  (o. c.) : aaaaaaaaahhh!.. 
[ext. cadupu desert - day] 
morty lands on his ass on a sand dune. there’s a military base planted in the desert nearby. 
morty: ow! that definitely still seemed a lot like hurting, rick! rick? morty dusts himself off and checks his gear. everything seems functional. he notices the base. 
morty: oh wow! the nuker fort! 
[int. irs military base - soon] 
morty creeps down a hallway, holding his chillometer like a pistol. 
morty: uh, hello? mister sergeant major commander? anyone? he finds a suit of irs armor and plops the helmet loosely on his head. 
morty: dude. awesome. he fiddles with the earpiece. 
morty: grey leader? grey leader do you copy? over. 
rick  (v. o.) : very funny, morty. did you find it? 
morty: negatory, i--the chillometer beeps. multiple blue dots appear on screen. 
morty: grey leader, i m reading multiple signatures fifty metres out. chillness level just under steve buscemi. 
rick  (v. o.) : that s gotta be the collarium, morty. get to it. morty stops in his tracks. he checks the scanner again. 
morty: uh, grey leader, signatures appear to be advancing. forty metres. 
rick  (v. o.) : uh oh. how s the chillness? 
morty: katy perry and dropping. thirty metres. 
rick  (v. o.) : this is not good, morty, not good. can you see them? morty glances around. nothing. 
morty: uh, negative. just passed kanye west. twenty metres. 
rick: kanye west? oh god-- 
morty: ten metres. 
rick: look up, morty! look up! big dramatic buildup. morty braces himself and looks up at the air duct. entirely empty. then, a huge rumbling. the ground caves away under morty and he falls into a deep, dark hole. 
morty: jesusholyshitchrist! 
[int. morty’s home - rick’s workshop - continuous] 
rick leans over the portal, walkie talkie to his head. the extra-long antenna pokes into the other dimension. 
rick: morty? morty? ah, raptor sharts. rick loads one of the two douchinon cells into his portal device and cannonballs through the floor. 
rick  (o. c.) : geronimooooooaglblagblagunfow. 
[int. kitchen - evening] 
pov: meatloaf in the oven. jerry opens the door and stares in like it s his new born child. 
jerry: (almost tearful) sometimes mother nature allows we mortals a glimpse of perfection. he gingerly removes the meatloaf and sets it on the table. 
jerry: kids! honey! dinner! beat. 
jerry: anyone? 
[int. living room - continuous] 
summer’s slouched on the couch. still blasted. still texting. 
summer: (stoned, typing on phone) amberrrrr. answerrrr. amber, i need to tell you something. jerry walks up in a huff. 
jerry: summer. dinner. 
summer: (stoned, typing on phone) at your tenth birthday, it wasn t your dog that peed on the bed. it was me. jerry rolls his eyes and heads upstairs. 
[int. jerry and beth’s bedroom - continuous] 
beth is curled up in bed. jerry enters. 
jerry: beth, our children are possessed by machines. 
beth: (nuzzling something) who s a fancy kitty? you are. you are. 
jerry: hey! what s going on in here? beth rolls over. she s cuddling a tablet. 
beth: look at this, jerry! there s this app that lets you put formalwear on other people s cats. whiskers here is a regular mister darcy, isn t he? isn t he? why yes you are. 
jerry: i see how it is. sure. if you need me i ll be with rick and morty. jerry stops in his tracks. i can t believe i just said that. 
[int. hallway - soon] 
jerry bangs on the door to rick’s workshop, meatloaf in hand. there’s a weird ‘mmph’ing sound coming from within. 
jerry: hello? rick? mmph. mmph. mmph. 
jerry: are you finally molesting my son? 
[int. rick’s workshop - continuous] 
jerry kicks in the door, balancing the meatloaf in one hand. across the room, half buried in junk, an old fax machine has been repurposed into some terrifying frankenstein-esque amalgamation. 
jerry: (whisper) my fax machine? 
fax machine: kill... me... 
jerry: unfortunately, fax machine, the euthanization laws in america are extremely complex. however--jerry steps inside... and falls straight through the floor portal. the meatloaf slips from his hands. 
jerry: no! my precious! 
[ext. cadupu desert - continuous] 
jerry lands with a thump in the desert. he looks around, panicked. the meatloaf lands safely in his lap. 
jerry: oh thank god. he looks up. seven irs soldiers hold a semicircle in front of him, all training autoguns. sergeant major commander nukington stands center. 
nukington: halt, intruder. you are in an irs restricted area. beat. 
hutchinson: hey, is that meatloaf? 
[int. collarium mine - sanctum - later] 
morty comes to. he’s being carried on the backs of the insectoid grubs into some deep chamber of the mine. 
morty: gah! help! let me down! the grubs throw morty down and form a ring around him. he looks up--the repulsive hivemind grub clicks its mandibles and leers down with its dozens of eyes. 
hivemind grub: rrrrrrarg. slurp slurp. it creeps toward morty. he grits his teeth like a hardened veteran. 
morty: god damn grubs. you never stood a chance. one day soon, a soldier just like me is gonna ride right in here, and you know what he s gonna do? the grubs exchange glances. they shake their heads. 
morty: he s gonna blow. your. shit. up. the grubs shrug and nod approvingly. suddenly, morty pulls out the magno-shield and hits the hivemind grub in the face. 
hivemind grub: my face, dude! way not cool. 
grub  1: yeah, i know we re trying method but that s just unsafe. 
grub  2: hr is gonna be all over this. i m calling it right now, man, prop handling course before the end of the week. the grubs are chittering. morty s freaking out. 
morty: no, no... he tries to get away and trips. his head s spinning. it s a mad house. a mad house! 
[int. morty’s home - jerry and beth’s bedroom - evening] 
still in bed, beth stares into her tablet. she giggles. 
beth: oh, mister rochester, you naughty tabby. 
[int. irs military base - mess hall - evening] 
the interplanetary republic sentinels sit around the barracks 
table digging in to jerry’s meatloaf. jerry leans back smugly in his chair like the king of the castle. 
hutchinson: gee, this stuff is fantastic! 
jerry: any time for my favorite federal bureau. 
irs soldier: i don t know how long it s been since we had something that wasn t packed into a cube. 
hutchinson: well, it is kind of a cube, technically. 
perez: your dick s a cube, hutchinson. hutchinson bows his head. an awkward silence forms. 
jerry: so... stepped it up with the uniforms this year, i see. totally sharp. you know, i really think you guys get a bad rap. 
nukington: the irs is the crushing arm of the republic. all else is irrelevant. 
jerry: wow. that s one way to get through the day. 
[int. collarium mine - sanctum - evening] 
grubs sit around the lair. smoking, chatting, complaining. everyone’s bored. the hivemind grub undulates along next to morty. 
morty: the siege of rakkadak? the imperial inconvenience? it s all just a big joke? 
hivemind grub: oh, completely. bad lighting, bad camera work, the producers are cheap bastards, and don t get me started on wardrobe. 
runner grub: hey everyone! reggie and i are doing a pizza run in five, i need to know who wants wagnblag testicle on theirs and who doesn t! the grubs start to bitch and moan. 
diva grub: are they magma-fed wagnblags? i m on a superterranean-only cleanse! 
runner grub: i have no idea. a wave of outcry. morty looks around. 
morty: at least maybe now i can get an autograph from mister nukington. 
hivemind grub: good luck, the dude s full on logan s run mode. all those humanoids are, network says it provides a more believable performance . they walk past a pretentious grub reenacting a scene to an audience of five. 
pretentious grub:--and secretly i was like i just had my claws waxed, there is no way i m playing dead again today. so i just stood there and said uh, oh no, you ve disabled my nervous stem. i can t move. rrugblugblug. 
grub  4: and he bought it? 
bragging grub: oh my god, completely. it was simply absurd. 
morty: (to the hivemind grub) s-so what you re saying is, they completely believe they re at war? 
hivemind grub: let me put it this way, man we don t see em in the break room. 
morty: wow. that s r-really not an ok thing to do to people! 
hivemind grub: welcome to the industry. morty stops and looks at the giant pile of collarium balls in the corner of the cave. 
morty: the thing is, i m here from from from from the department of uh radioactive balls. yeah. and whooh boy are those balls radioactive. a group of grubs starts to form. seriously. my hot pockets are nearly ready to eat, if you know what i mean. what i m saying is, i need to grab em and and send em off the be de-radiatified. morty is entirely encircled. he s sweating. you know, they re probably giving us cancer right now. or whatever you gruh-uh-great actors get. space cancer. 
hivemind grub: anything you need, my dude. 
morty: wait, just like that? 
hivemind grub: totally. just give a shout to my man greg in props and services on your way, would ya? 
[int. irs military base - mess hall - evening] 
the troopers are full and content. jerry sits next to nukington. 
jerry: thanks again for having me, mister nukington. you guys are the bomb. 
nukington: you ve got spirit, jerry. in all the time i ve been here we ve never seen a single supply run. 
jerry: sequester hit pretty hard, huh? 
nukington: tell me, boy, how would you like to be an honorary member of the irs? you d get to call me sergeant major commander nukington. 
jerry: really? wow. i ve always wanted-- 
nukington: excellent. we re making an attack soon and i need all the troops i can muster. 
perez: damn grubs are crawling all over this planet. 
hutchinson: i always thought they look way more like insects, personally. 
perez: your dick s an insect, hutchinson. hutchinson looks dejected. an alarm blares and a tv screen drops down from the ceiling. nukington stands and salutes. a douchey guy in a suit and sunglasses appears onscreen. 
nukington: general cashmore, sir! 
cashmore: nukington. you ve got a new supreme directive, effective immediately. 
[int. collarium mine - sanctum - night] 
morty struggles to heave the collarium balls into a huge sack. he slips, they all roll back out. a grub walks drinking a diet cola. 
morty: can you give me a hand, er, tentacle, er, appendage with this? 
cola grub: sorry bro. not in my contract. a security guard grub comes up from behind. 
security grub: need some help? 
morty: uh, sure, thanks. they both start collecting balls. 
security grub: gee is it great to see a humanoid down here. 
morty: really? i kinda get the sense that everyone hates my guts. 
security grub: oh, that s just actors. 
morty: guess you ve got kind of a shitty job, then. guarding a big pile of apparently radioactive balls in the middle of nowhere? 
security grub: so that s why my johnson s been glowing. but hey, focus on the positive, you know? if you get worked up about every little thing you ll miss all life s golden opportunities. beat. morty stares at the guy. 
morty: why are you so happy? it s really kinda weirding me out. suddenly, rick comes running up to morty. he nearly collapses panting. 
rick: morty! you re still alive! 
morty: rick! listen, the-- 
rick: you know how long i was running, morty? like h-h-half an episode! i m amazed they didn t (hic) gut you already! 
morty: you gotta listen to me, rick-- 
rick: i was expecting (burp) entrails everywhere. vital organs strewn like like like tinsel, morty! you know, on flegaflem they have (hic) christmas, but instead of ornaments it s eyeballs! human eyeballs on a tree, morty! red, green, (hic) blue. and that s nothing compared to-- 
morty: (yelling) rick! the cadupuians are-- 
rick: what, morty? the cadupuians are what? 
morty: cool. they re cool. beat. the security grub speaks up behind rick. 
security grub: look, i didn t want to bring this up, but you guys might get busted walking around without badges. rick spins around and punches the security grub in the mouth. he tumbles. 
security grub: ow! oh, gosh darn it! my mandible! 
rick: really? because that thing just tried to eat me. does eating people seem cool to you? the security grub gets up and rubs its face. 
security grub: look, i m sorry. i snuck up on you. totally my bad, man. 
rick: aah! it s still alive! run, morty! rick punches it again. he shoots a portal on the ground under the pile--morty and the collarium balls fall through. 
[int. morty’s home - rick’s workshop - night] 
morty flies through a portal in the ceiling and lands atop the collarium. it bounces and gives. a pause, then rick thuds on to morty. 
rick: thanks for (hic) breaking my fall there, morty. 
morty: unf, my chest. think maybe you could make normal portals from now on? 
rick: you can t just tell science where to (hic) happen, morty, she s just gonna go for it wherever she wants whether you like it or not. hey, your spine s intact, what gives? rick bounces up and down on the pile of balls. these aren t collarium crystals, they re volleyballs! 
morty: well yeah, rick. that s what i was trying to say. the war on grubs is just made up for tv. 
rick: you really coulda said that before i (burp) risked my ass for you, morty. rick stands up. he sets down his portal device. now we re at nothing. square one. i gotta come up with a new scheme, a new adventure, a n-new life-or-death getaway. these escapades aren t just for (hic) shits and giggles, morty. 
[int. living room - continuous] 
morty turns on the lights and looks around. summer is frantically scrolling through text messages. 
summer: morty, oh my god, i m freaking out. i can t remember anything and the tv s all messed up and i m out of texts and amber refuses to talk to me. 
morty: so you re back to normal. are we doing burger closet? 
summer: no way. i cannot go near the mall for like five hundred years i am completely mortified. 
morty: cock master, then? 
summer: i could go for a cock special. morty s eyes drift to the screen. 
morty: what s wrong with the television, summer? summer turns and points. 
summer: look, it s stuck on the stupid dad-is-a-movie-star universe again. jerry runs with the irs troopers in full power armor through the mine tunnels. 
announcer  (v. o.) : breaking news, the interplanetary republic sentinels lead an all-out assault on the dastardly grub hivemind alongside fearless new recruit jerry smith. 
morty: oh come on. 
[int. collarium mine - tunnels - soon] 
deep in the mines, nukington rallies his men. 
nukington: ok, troopers, this is the proving ground. the last hurdle. the final labor. the judgement day. the-- 
perez: we ve got it, sarge. 
nukington: no, no, i have a few more. the leap of faith. the last hurrah. the task to separate the men and also women from the boys and girls, equally of course. beat. i m done. 
hutchinson: so what s the game plan? 
nukington: game plan is, corporal, we bust in there and kill every god damn thing that moves. no matter what. 
hutchinson: are you saying we don t have selective fire restrictions, sir? 
perez: your dick s got selective fire restrictions, hutchinson. hutchinson sighs and looks down. 
hutchinson: (heartfelt, hurt) perez, why are you always so mean to me? 
perez: i... i don t know. i guess i was just embracing the stereotype. i m sorry. perez hugs hutchinson. he smiles. 
nukington: alright, very nice, now let s go commit some genocide! private smith you re on point. 
jerry: yes sir. irs, move out! 
[int. collarium mine - sanctum - soon] 
there’s a six-legged catering truck in the middle of the sanctum. the grubs stand around and pick at their food. still complaining. 
diva grub: i thought i said crushed gravel. look at this. this is almost pebbles . a portal opens on the wall, near the ceiling. rick and morty step through and land on their faces. 
morty: not better! they stand and dust themselves off. rick surveys the scene. 
rick: you weren t k-kidding, morty. this planet s a nightmare, and something smells like volcanic (burp) nutsack. let s find your dad and bug out. get it, morty? bug out? eh? eh? 
morty: that s kinda racist, rick. rick leads morty to the exit, but the security grub stops them. 
security grub: excuse me! humanoid! rick turns to face him and builds up a punch. the grub cringes. 
rick: nah, i m just fuckin with you. 
security grub: hey, i want to apologize again for freaking you out earlier. 
rick: yeah, sure, whatever weirdo. we re k-k-kinda in a pinch right now, i m looking for a runaway human male. middle aged, balding, stupid face. may or may not be pissed about a fax machine. comprendo? 
security grub: as a security agent and friend, i ll do whatever i can to help you find this man, i promise. wham. corporal perez leaps out of the caves and smacks the security grub s face with the butt of her autogun. he tumbles--again. 
security grub: aag! son of a gun! 
rick: actually, never mind. we found him. the rest of the irs pours in and forms a firing line. jerry s front and center, next to nukington. 
jerry: alright, you two-faced tax-dodging strangely insect-like criminals! we re done playing nice. it s time you know the true power of the internal revenue service! 
hutchinson: wait, huh? 
nukington: set autoguns to maximum kill! 
morty: oh no, rick! w-w-w-we gotta do something! 
rick: it s too late for them, morty. they re dead meat. morty overts his eyes--and sees the magno-shield on his hip. 
morty: the magno-shield! slow motion as he deftly pressed the button and tosses it at the ground between the irs and the grubs. plunk. it hits the ground. no result. 
rick: you know how much a real magno-shield costs? do you, morty? me neither, cause i don t have enough (hic) smidgens to even dock at the stations that sell em! you think i d give something like that to a kid who who who can t even tell a high-energy (hic) storage medium from a chocolate chip cookie? 
morty: well, i mean, my life was-- not a smart business strategy, morty. not smart at all. rick points at the magno-shield . that s just a walkman with some rocks in it, morty. 
morty: what s a walkman? 
nukington: enough of this artificial tension building. fire! close on the irs troopers as they open fire. endless waves of bullets spraying out, over and over, drowning all else. eventually the magazines run dry. gun barrels smoke, all turns to silence. pull back. everyone is standing right as they were. dead stares all around. 
hutchinson: it s... an act of god. 
nukington: nuker troopers, switch to combat knives, we re gutting em by hand! 
rick: oh shitbiscuits. the troopers, including jerry, bear blades and each spring on the nearest grub. jerry s about to pry one s shell open. 
pinned grub: christ, dude! we don t even know each other! 
jerry: should have thought about that when you were listing your dependants! 
cashmore  (v. o.) : (over loudspeaker) ok, cut! we can work with this. the lights go up. the creepy cave atmosphere gives way to dry, bright soundstage. a large chunk of wall rises and reveals a camera unit. cashmore and an entourage of film crew step out of the shadows. nukington stands and outstretches his hand. 
nukington: mister cashmore, sir! it s a pleasure to see you again. 
cashmore: that s executive cashmore to you. 
morty: (to self) i thought they were supposed to be brainwashed clones... 
cashmore: well, yeah. and then we tell them they re actors. 
cashmore s lackey: we might be evil, but we know a massive liability issue when we see one. he motions to his crew. 
cashmore: get catering out of here. tell the cadupuians they re cut loose. i want all the lighting down by the end of the day. jerry notices the duo. he walks over. 
jerry: (pleased) rick? morty? what are you guys doing here? 
rick: we re getting you home, jerry, you re drunk. 
jerry: no i m not! i feel great! 
rick: yes you are. rick zaps jerry with a pocket drunkifier and he doubles over. 
jerry: oh (heave) where are my keys? somebody please take my keys. 
morty: that explains everything. rick opens a portal on the wall. 
rick: welp. so much for this planet. cashmore holds up a men in black style mind-wiper in front of nukington. 
cashmore: goodnight, sergeant . 
morty: mister cashmore! wait! morty runs up to cashmore, who folds his arms. rick groans and comes along. you can t just enslave actors and erase their memories! 
cashmore: i m an executive, son, i can do whatever i want. 
rick: he s right, morty. come on. there s other tv shows in the universe. 
morty: it s not about the show! it s about basic human compassion! 
cashmore: you know, you two wouldn t make a bad series yourselves. what do you think, dave? 
rick: that is the worst idea i ve ever heard. 
cashmore: look. the show s still cancelled. the collarium s gone. the grubs are defeated. there s nowhere left for it to go. the walkman finally clicks on. some sappy 70s love song plays. 
rick: at least it s still a better ending than-- 
morty: (yell-whisper) guys! shh! look! everyone quiets down and looks. perez is helping the security grub off the ground when they lock eyes. push in on theirlovestruck stares. 
perez: i m... i m sorry i hit you in the face with a fake machine gun. 
security grub: no, it s alright. it was strangely arousing. they kiss and embrace. there s cheering from the crowd. cashmore furrows his brow. 
morty: d-don t you see? it s perfect! action is so out of style! after the war, two young lovers-one human and one alien-try to start a life on cadupu, but they each still have their families in tow. you ve got romance, family drama, a multiple-species target audience, and a progressive message that still ultimately leans on outdated stereotypes! silence. what? what can i say? i watch a lot of tv. 
cashmore: that s a pretty good idea, son. i d like to buy the rights for five cashbucks. that s the official currency of cashmore studios. you d be a professional ideamaker. 
morty: (excited) wow! that sounds really-- 
rick: horrible. no deal. 
cashmore: (irritated) fine. what are your terms? 
rick: do you have douchinon? 
cashmore s lackey: oh, we have loads of douchinon. 
rick: fifteen hundred douchinon cells. no more freaky alien mindwiping. 
cashmore: or what? 
rick: or we walk and take the idea to smarmodyne. morty looks over at the prop weapons being collected. 
morty: and i get to keep the megaflamethrower! 
cashmore: (sigh) done. dave, see too it that these men receive their douchinon, and tell the writing department they re going to need at least fifty percent more monkeys. either that, or find a way to make the monkeys type fifty percent faster. doesn t really matter. 
morty: shouldn t i need to sign something or something? 
cashmore: don t sweat it, son. we ll be in touch. 
[int. morty’s home - living room - night] 
rick helps jerry walk into the living room. morty trails behind. summer looks up, beth comes in from the kitchen. 
beth: jerry! morty! there you are. i was so worried. 
rick: yeah, great (hic) great to see you too, beth. 
summer: morty! dennis just said he wants to start seriously hanging out. and amber thinks it s totally cool that i peed on her bed. which is kinda weird. but still. 
rick: wow. that sure worked out real perfect and nice and and perfect for you, huh summer? no killer aliens, no cutthroat executives... 
summer: ugh. just because i m offscreen doesn t mean i can t have an arc. 
jerry: (drunk) f-f-fax machine. 
beth: what? 
rick: nothing. nothing. he says he s says h-h-he s fine, beth. say, who s up for master cock? 
morty: i m kind of tired of cock, rick. 
jerry: (drunk) i knew it! i-i knew it. 
beth: well, jerry was going to cook tonight, but--jerry vomits all over the carpet. i guess we could go to... morty and summer are giving her puppy eyes. ok. you win. i ll see what s in the freezer. 
rick: yeah, alright! one big h-h-happy family, boys and girls! 
[ext. cadupu desert - day] 
announcer  (v. o.) : in a world ravaged by war. pan over a few actor grubs doing their best crippling-pain impression. two families from entirely different solar systems. the irs soldiers, redone as a large space-trooper family posing for a family portrait. then the grubs, sitting around a dining room table and a hideous alien roast. must come together... to party. beat drop. the irs and grubs get down on a dance floor. various shots of drinking and shouting. a crowd gathers around a grub marine breakdancing contest. 
announcer  (v. o.) : starring terry nukington! nukington and a grub kid play catch with a grenade. 
nukington: oops. run for cover! laugh track. 
announcer  (v. o.) : big daddy hivemind! the hivemind sits and councils hutchinson. 
hivemind grub: the collective consciousness of my entire species and all our ancestors for thousands of millennia is reaching out to tell me that you re pretty much boned. laugh track. 
announcer  (v. o.) : tina and franklin perez! perez and the security grub lying in bed. she peeks under the sheets. 
perez: wow! it really does glow! laugh track. cycle through various clips and stills. 
announcer  (v. o.) : in a multispecies smash hit that s sure to have your family saying i never knew war mongering extraterrestrials could be so fun! the title comes up on screen my alien in-laws. a subtitle based on the works of several monkeys who ate paper containing a pitch inspired by the ideas of morti smeth. 
[int. morty’s home - living room - day] 
the whole family sits around the couch together. morty jumps and points at the screen. he’s wearing the megaflamethrower prop. 
morty: that s me! look! i m on intergalactic television! 
rick: congratulations, morty. you ve taken your first step into a (burp) shittier world. 
jerry: i still don t see where taxes come into all this. 
[int. garage - day] 
rick sits at his workbench making tweaks to his portal gun. 
rick: that s the last time i take this thing to an intergalactic strip club. rick sticks his finger in a glob of goo that was hidden behind the handle. he slowly pulls his hand away as the goo stretches thin between the two. well, that s nasty. he shakes the goo off his finger. it splats on the floor. morty enters. hey rick. morty 
rick: well if it isn t my prepubescent (burp) chud of a grandson. what brings you to my lair of creative genius? rick takes a drink from his flask. 
morty: i was wondering, since you re such a smart scientist-- 
rick: smartest. i m the smartest scientist. 
morty: yes, since you re the smartest scientist of all time, how come you haven t figured out a way to travel back in time? rick immediately stops working on his gun. turns to look at morty, irritated."the mortyfly effect"rick and morty 
rick: what makes you think i haven t figured out time travel? 
morty: i don t know. we ve never, uh, gone on any time travel adventures before, or even tried to fix any of the messes we ve made. 
rick: so, you expect by traveling back in time we can just fix any mistake we ve made and alter the past in whatever (burp) way we please? morty shrugs. 
morty: yeah, why not? 
rick: why not? one does not simply just travel back in time to fix their problems morty. 
morty: it seems pretty simple. 
rick: you re pretty simple, morty. your tiny brain can t begin to comprehend the complex nature that goes into time travel. 
morty: maybe you re right... or maybe you re just saying all that because you don t know how to do it. morty smirks. rick lets out a sarcastic laugh. 
rick: well, look who s balls dropped overnight! you think you can just walk in here and talk down to the great rick sanchez like that? 
morty: i think i just did. rick glares at morty and grinds his teeth. he shoots up from his workbench, walks to the shelving unit located against the wall, and grabs a cardboard box labeled time travel stuff from the top shelf. he drops the box on the ground and digs through it, tossing items everywhere. 
rick: (under his breath) i ll show you, you little piece of shit. rick finds a wand looking device and holds it up in the air. he gets up from the ground, grabs morty by the arm and presses the one button located on the side of the wand. they instantly disappear. hey morty? 
jerry  (o. s.) : jerry enters. can you help your old man glue the last piece of his p-40b tiger shark model plane? he looks around the empty room, confused. could have sworn he was out here... 
[ext. prehistoric era jungle - day] 
rick and morty appear, surrounded by overgrown wild life and gigantic herbivorous dinosaurs. 
morty: holy shit, rick! are those dinosaurs? 
rick: why yes they are morty! 
morty: how did you get us here? 
rick: remember that time i said i do know how to travel through time? boom, uncle rick strikes again. he takes a drink from his flask. 
morty: this is incredible rick. morty begins to step forward. nooo! 
rick: morty puts his foot down and steps on a plant. what have you done! you can t interfere with anything in the past morty! 
morty: what did i do? 
rick: you stepped on a plant! so? 
morty: rick drops down to look under morty s shoe. he slowly lifts morty s foot from the plant. 
rick: damn it, morty! you really fucked this one up! 
morty: what s the big deal? it s just a tiny plant. 
rick: this tiny plant could alter everything we know back home! do you have any idea what chain of events you might have disrupted by stepping on this one, magnificent little plant? rick tries to lift the plant back up, but it crumbles to the ground immediately. 
morty: maybe it didn t alter anything. maybe you re just overreacting. 
rick: you really have no concept of anything involving an ounce of intelligence morty. 
morty: (upset) sorry if i m trying to be a little optimistic here, rick. rick adjusts his time travel device. 
rick: well, i guess we will see if your optimism translates to anything worth while in a moment then, won t we. rick grabs morty by the wrist again and proceeds to press the same button on the wand. they disappear. 
[int. garage - present day] 
they look around the garage for any signs of alteration. nothing seems out of the ordinary. 
morty: see rick, that stupid plant didn t impact anything. rick looks at the wall where a red banner hangs behind the shelving. 
rick: wait a minute. he walks to the wall and pushes the shelving unit down, exposing a massive nazi flag. oh my god! morty 
rick: holy shit, morty! you altered the outcome of world war ii! the nazis were never overthrown! we re nazis morty! what the fuck did you do morty! 
morty: i-i-i didn t mean to! oh geez rick, what do we do! we have to fix this! hey morty? jerry (o. s.) 
rick: shit morty, it s your racist nazi father. act cool. jerry enters. he has a tiny mustache. 
jerry: son, would you mind assisting your father in assembling the final piece of his fokker e ii eindecker german fighter model plane? they both stare at jerry and his unfortunate facial hair. 
morty: uh, yeah, sure dad. just give me a few minutes. i m, uh, finishing up something with rick. 
rick: yeah, i ll send him in when we are done here, jerry. 
jerry: alright, please meet me in the kitchen once you are willing and able to help--rick takes an extra large drink from his flask. heil hitler. rick spits the alcohol out all over morty. 
rick: sorry.. wrong pipe.. what you said. jerry nods and heads back inside. 
morty: (to rick) fix this now rick! 
rick: i m working on it, kid. rick continues to adjust his time travel device, turning back the nob several clicks. alright, morty, if my calculations are correct, which they are, we should arrive in the past exactly ten seconds before you literally fuck up history in the worst way possible. 
morty: i don t understand how one plant can alter history that much. like, what was so special about that plant for it to change the outcome of an entire war? 
rick: seems a bit farfetched, i know, but it definitely drives home the scientific theory that a single occurrence, no matter how small, can change the course of the universe forever. both characters break the fourth wall and stare directly at the screen. rick makes one final tweak. ok, here goes nothing. he presses the button. both disappear. 
[ext. prehistoric era jungle - day] 
rick and morty reappear at the same location. 
rick: when the other versions of us show up, don t say or do anything. but--morty 
rick: not a thing morty! stay out of it. ok... 
morty: rick checks his watch as another rick and morty appear just feet away. 
rick: nobody move! the newly appeared rick and morty look over, confused. 
rick 2: damn it, morty! what did you do! 
morty 2: i didn t do anything, rick! 
morty: not yet, but you will. 
rick: shut up, morty. i said stay out of it. 
morty: right, sorry. sorry. morty 2 
rick 2: not you, morty. 
morty 2: ok, sorry rick. their conversation catches the attention of a nearby triceratops. it roars and begins to charge the group. 
morty: rick! what do we do? crap. rick 
morty 2: we re going to die here! morty 2 begins to run for it. 
rick: other morty! stop running away, you re only making this worse! 
rick 2: listen to me, morty. if you step on anything, you could alter the course of history. 
morty: yeah, we learned that the hard way, right rick? the triceratops grows closer to the group. 
rick 2: morty, wait for me! other rick sprints after his morty. 
rick: well, this went horribly wrong. again. rick readjusts his time travel device. both rick and morty disappear right before the triceratops spears them. 
[ext. prehistoric era jungle - several seconds earlier] 
rick and morty reappear. 
morty: so, what s your plan this time? 
rick: not sure yet. 
morty: well, don t we only have a few seconds before we appear again? 
rick: i sent us back even further. i ve got some time to work with. other rick and morty appear next to them. oh for fucks sake. 
rick 2: what d you expect? we re the same person. maybe if you stuck around to discuss with me before you went back in time we wouldn t be in this situation. 
rick: touche other rick. guess it s a bit late for that now though. 
morty 2: so, what do we do? or not do? i m confused rick. 
morty: yeah, rick, what s going on? 
rick: just don t do anything. again. and stay quiet so we don t draw any attention. 
rick 2: do you have a plan for when we appear? 
rick: no, i was hoping you did. rick 3 and morty 3 appear directly in front of them. everyone stares at each other. 
rick 3: so, this plan didn t work? nope. what now? no idea. 
morty 3: oh geez rick. what the hell is going on? 
rick 3: shut up, morty. 
rick: shut up, morty. 
rick 2: yeah, shut up, morty. 
morty: leave him alone, rick! no reason to gang up on the guy. 
morty 3: thanks other me. 
morty: no problem. us morty s need to stick together. 
rick: you re the same morty! 
morty 2: but we all exist in this moment. 
morty 3: yeah! how is this possible? 
rick: please morty! shut the fuck up and let me think! all three morty s look at rick, upset and quiet. think rick, think. rick and morty 4 appear before the group. 
morty 4: what the hell? 
rick 4: damn it, morty! what did you do! 
rick 3: nobody move! 
rick: dammit other rick! i told you that plan doesn t work! the same triceratops spots the group again and charges. 
morty 4: run for your lives! 
rick 2: don t move! rick takes a drink from his flask. 
rick: let him go. we already fucked this up. see you all in ten seconds. rick readjusts the device and disappears with his morty. 
[int. garage - present day] 
the garage is empty. nothing looks the same as before. the room has a very futuristic look with floating furniture and neon lights. rick’s workbench hasn’t changed. 
jerry  (o. s.) : hey morty, are you out here? jerry enters garage, looking fit and in shape. his clothes resemble a style that is other worldly. morty? rick? hmm.. i could have sworn i heard them out here. he holds an intergalactic federation space cruiser model kit. now who will help me finish my intergalactic xeno omega iv space cruiser? 
summer  (o. s.) : i can help you, dad! jerry pokes his head back inside the house. 
jerry: yeah? you d do that for your father? summer sits on the living room couch. 
summer: of course i would! i always hoped one day you d ask me to help you work on one of your amazing model ships! 
jerry: well, ok then! let s get this ship into orbit. jerry walks back inside. the futuristic sliding door closes behind him. 
[ext. prehistoric era jungle - day] 
there are currently over forty pairs of rick and morty, arguing amongst themselves. 
morty: geez rick, this is seriously getting out of hand. 
rick: thanks for pointing that out, morty. i m sure i couldn t have figured that out all on my own, morty. real big help you are. 
morty: i m just saying. don t have to be a dick about it. rick ignores morty and counts all the other rick and mortys that surround them. did you hear me rick? 
rick: not now, morty. let me think for a minute. 
morty: you ve been thinking for the past hour! it hasn t gotten us anywhere. 
rick: technically, it s only been a few seconds, but yeah, i m working on it boss. a tyrannosaurus rex eats a morty. 
morty 26: oh my god! we re being eaten! 
morty 32: everybody run for your lives! all the mortys begin to panic and run around aimlessly. several ricks take a drink from their flasks. 
rick 17: what do we do now, other rick? rick 17 zaps a charging stegosaurus, it disintegrates. he takes another sip from his flask. 
rick: i m working on it. maybe if some of you lazy assholes helped out a little, i d be able to solve this problem that much faster. 
rick 7: you re the one that got us into this mess, you can find us a way out. 
rick 29: this is why we never time travel! 
rick: don t you think i know that? it s all this little bastards fault. 
morty: i said i was sorry, rick! 
rick: well, sometimes sorry doesn t correct the cluster fuck of a situation your dumbass manages to get us in, now does it, morty? 
morty: you know what, rick? you can deal with this on your own. i m out of here. 
rick: finally! i ve been waiting for you to throw your little bitch fit so you d storm off and leave me the fuck alone so i can think. rick finishes his count of the group. he pulls out his portal gun and takes off a component. he sticks his time travel device inside, attempting to combine the two. morty looks at rick, eyes welling up. he clenches his fists. 
morty: let s go, mortys. we don t need rick and his crap attitude. 
morty 34: but we ll die out there! 
morty 3: how will we defend ourselves without rick? 
morty: shut up! all of you! if you die, you die! technically, none of you even exist! 
morty 6: we don t exist? 
rick: morty, can you speed up the dramatic exit please? rick continues to tweak his device. 
morty: follow me if you want, or don t, i don t give a shit anymore! morty storms off and heads into a dark, swampy marsh. a majority of the mortys follow behind. 
[int. living room - present day] 
jerry and summer, both bald now, assemble the last pieces of the model space cruiser. the living room is filled with futuristic decor. furniture floats around the room as a robot vacuums the carpet behind them. 
jerry: all this time i had no idea you d be interested in hanging out with your old man. 
summer: of course i did, dad! you saw how jealous i d get when morty got to hang out with you all the time. i ve just been patently waiting for my turn to hang out with my cool pops. jerry smiles and hugs summer. 
jerry: you truly are a wonderful daughter. 
summer: and you re a wonderful dad! 
beth  (o. s.) : and an incredible husband! beth, also bald, enters the room with a tray of brownies, apron still draped over her clothes. 
jerry: are those brownies? 
beth: they sure are! just a little token of my appreciation for the greatest man in the universe. jerry s eyes glow at the sight of brownies. 
summer: you know how to pick a winner, mom. i sure do. beth 
jerry: you guys, what did i do to deserve such a loving family? jerry grabs a brownie from the tray and takes a bite. and they re still gooey on the inside! you know just the way i like them, beth. 
beth: of course. only the best for my main squeeze. she gives him a head rub as he smiles. 
summer: last piece! summer attaches the last piece onto the model ship. it snaps onto the wing. 
jerry: it s beautiful. i can t wait to display it in my office. 
summer: now you ll have something that will always remind you me of me! 
jerry: i sure will. he hugs summer and rubs her head. then hugs beth and rubs her head too. boy, will morty be mad he missed out on this. he better be having the time of his life after missing out on all the fun we re having. 
[ext. prehistoric era swampy marsh - later] 
the group of mortys are frantically running around the jungle, screaming and crying. they are getting picked off by dinosaurs, reptiles, venus fly traps, and quick sand, among other things. 
morty 26: morty number 1! what should we do? 
morty: i don t know 26! i ve never been in this position before! 
morty 32: well, you re the one that said we didn t need rick. help us! a morty without a head runs through the group. 
morty: jesus christ! morty frantically looks around the jungle. he notices a large island in the middle of the swamp. over there! let s swim to the island. these creatures can t reach us there! morty sprints towards the water. the remaining mortys follow quickly behind. they enter the water and swim. 
morty 40: oh geez! the water is too thick to swim! i can t make it! 
morty: you have to! it s the only way to survive! the group of morty s struggle through the thick, black swamp water. morty 9 is leading the pack. 
morty 9: i m almost there! we can make it! an enormous alligator, ten times the size of a regular alligator, surfaces from the swamp, open jaws. 
morty: morty 9! noooooo! the alligator swallows morty 9 in one bite and disappears under the muck. swim faster! the group quickens their pace towards the island. the alligator claims another victim as morty reaches the island and climbs up. he assists the others up as they quickly crowd the small landmass. 
morty 34: now what do we do? 
morty: we sit tight and wait for rick to fix this. we ll be safe here on this island. morty s island. two alligators circle the island, watching the mortys. see! they can t get to us up here. the group of fifteen celebrate, feeling safe on the island. holy shit! 
morty 23: a pterodactyl swoops down from above and snags a helpless morty. he screams as he s lifted away. 
morty: jesus christ! i m sorry morty 23! 
morty 4: if rick doesn t get us out of here soon, we re all going to be dead! 
[ext. prehistoric era jungle - simultaneous] 
rick makes some final adjustments to his portal gun. several ricks sit around him and watch, bored. 
rick 37: are you done yet, your highness? 
rick: as a matter of fact--rick raises up his new and improved portal gun. suck on this mother fucker! the ricks look at it in amazement. 
rick 27: what does it do? 
rick: well, rick 27, i have managed to reconfigure my portal gun to interact with my time travel device when i select this setting. he shows the gun to the group. there is now a new setting on the dial that has fix time etched in chicken scratch on the side of the handle. once i establish a portal, i can link one end to this time line, while linking the other end to the present time line. i can then send every rick and morty back to the present before anyone can even leave a footprint. the group of rick s talk amongst themselves. once they agree with the plan, they give rick a round of applause. thank you, thank you. i know, i m a genius. 
rick 17: how soon till we can fix the past? rick looks around for any sign of morty. 
rick: as soon as we find that pain in the ass of a grandson. 
[int. living room - present day] 
the world is now in a state of cubism. everything is two dimensional. jerry, oval face with unproportional ears, sits on the oddly shaped couch. summer texts on her stone tablet. beth drinks wine from a gold goblet. jerry is putting the finishing touches on his model paper airplane, standard five fold. 
jerry: can one of you wonderful young ladies help the old man out with the last crease on my vintage fancy flyer xl circa 1984 class iii? nope. sure. bethsummer 
jerry: really? you d do that for me? 
summer: of course, dad! summer, pencil thin with noodle like hair, gets up from her chair and walks over to jerry. he hands her the paper airplane. she instantly crumbles it up. 
jerry: no! why would you do that? 
summer: creating model planes is not a productive way to spend your time. you should be doing something that your family can be proud of you for, like working and getting paid. 
jerry: you know what summer? that s the last time i ask you for anything! i thought we were friends. 
summer: guess you thought wrong. she sits back down and begins typing on her stone tablet again. 
jerry: screw you guys. i m going to see what morty is up to. he at least tries to be a half decent person. jerry gets up and walks towards the garage. hey morty? you out there? jerry opens the garage door and looks in. it s empty. hmmm. i wonder where that boy could be? 
[ext. prehistoric era swampy marsh - day] 
morty lays out on the island next to the remaining three other mortys. they all scream as they look up at the circling pterodactyls. 
morty 26: this is it, we re all going to die! 
morty: stay calm! maybe they re full and will leave us alone. a pterodactyl swoops down and picks off one of the mortys. or not. the sound of slashing is heard through the thick brush. 
morty 32: do you hear that? rick slashes through the last of the thick grass and vines. him and several of the other ricks spot the group. 
morty: rick! help us! we re trapped out here! 
rick: morty! how many of you are left? morty looks around at the small group. 
morty: four of us. rick 29 laughs in the background. 
rick: dammit! why couldn t you hang on to just two more! 
rick 29: that ll be 300 tickets to blips and chitz! pay up boys! 
rick 5: do you accept payment by courier flap? 
morty: (irate) you bet on how many mortys would die before you finally got us out of here? are you serious rick? 
rick: of course we did. that bet was a sure thing, but i guess i gave you more credit than you were worthy of. rick perfectly times a jump cross the water. he steps on both alligator heads as he crosses and leaps over to the island. 
morty: i can t believe you right now, rick! how could you do that to me. 
rick: relax morty, you weren t one of the mortys i bet against. you made my final six. i could have been like rick 26 and bet against you. 
morty 26: you bet on me dying? 
rick 26: yup, 0 for 2 on bets today, i m afraid. rick 26 hands over blips and chitz tickets to another rick. 
rick: see? i m not that bad. 
morty: i guess that kind of makes it better. but only by a little. 
rick: well, a little is good enough for me. now, how about we get out of here. 
morty: i d like that. 
rick: (to other ricks) i am leaving you all now! nobody follow after me and try to fix this. you will only make it worse. i will be the rick to restore order as if none of you ever existed. that s the way it has to be. 
rick 2: god speed, rick! make us other ricks proud. rick nods and bids the group farewell. he grabs morty by the wrist, they disappear. 
[int. garage - present day] 
rick and morty appear in the cubism reality. rick and morty look around the garage confused. 
rick: whoa... this is trippy. he walks to his two dimensional workbench and pushes it over. it falls flat to the floor. 
morty: what is this place? 
rick: i guess it s the garage. looks like pacasso took a few too many tabs, am i right? 
morty: i don t get it. 
rick: probably better off that way. 
jerry  (o. s.) : hey morty? you out there? both rick and morty turn towards the door as jerry enters. morty shrieks. 
rick: jesus, jerry! your face! 
jerry: (shocked) my face? what wrong with your face? 
rick: my face is normal, jerry. yours is an abomination. 
morty: is that how we all look in this reality? 
jerry: of course it is! it s how we ve always looked! 
rick: no, it s not jerry. now if you ll excuse us, we have a mess to clean up, and by mess, i m talking about your face. rick walks towards jerry and leads him back into the house. 
jerry: but i have so many questions! no time. 
rick: rick pushes him out and closes the door. he locks it. geez, morty, you really did a number on you father. 
morty: that was disturbing. 
rick: very. so here s the plan. i m going to set up several portals that end here in this garage. rick shoots five portal holes at the wall. all are green. i will link these exits to the many portals i will create when i jump back in time. 
morty: what should i do? 
rick: you are going to stay here and make sure nobody gets out or interferes with anything while i m gone. 
morty: you want me to stay here in this ass-backwards world? what s going to happen to me when you fix everything? 
rick: we are still in the present day, but at the moment, our reality is totally fucked. once i begin to send the other rick and mortys through these portals, things should go back to normal. at least that s what i m banking on. 
morty: oh geez rick, what if this plan doesn t work? will i be trapped in this reality forever? 
rick: possibly, but it s a risk we have to take. you saw your father. we can t leave things the way they are. 
morty: alright. please make this work. i will. 
rick: rick resets his device. here goes nothing, kid. he disappears. good luck. morty 
[ext. prehistoric era jungle - day] 
rick appears. there are no other rick and mortys in the area. he begins strategically placing portals throughout the area, remembering the exact spots that each pair appeared. each portal is placed on the ground so that when a rick and morty appear, they will immediately fall into the hole and be transported to the present day until they vanish. 
rick: this plan better work. the first wave of rick and mortys appears, all immediately fall into their respective portal. others continue to pop up, just to disappear instantly. alright, morty. do your thing. 
[int. garage - simultaneous] 
morty watches as rick and mortys pour into the garage from each portal. he screams as he watches in horror. as more pour in, he notices some of the older versions start to vanish. the garage begins to change around him as more flood the room. the room changes from futuristic decor, to gothic decor, to all white decor, etc. 
morty: it s working! he celebrates as more continue to pour in. 
[ext. prehistoric era jungle - continuous] 
the last few rick and mortys appear. rick takes a sip from his flask as the final, original, time traveling rick and morty appear. there is no portal waiting under their feet. they both spot rick leaning against a boulder. 
rick 2: what did he do? 
rick: the plant. don t step on it. morty 2 looks down at the plant. 
morty: oh geez. what happens if i do? 
rick: so much. so fucking much. 
rick 2: well, thanks for the heads up other rick. 
rick: my pleasure, other rick. now that you ve seen the past--rick shoots a portal underneath their feet. it s time to call it a day. both rick and morty 2 fall into the portal. 
[int. garage - simultaneous] 
rick and morty 2 land in the garage. only morty is left. everything is back to the way it was before. 
morty 2: goodbye other morty. 
morty: goodbye other me. both rick and morty 2 slowly vanish. rick pops out of the middle portal, flask in hand. all five portals close behind him. morty runs over to him and gives him a hug. 
rick: easy there champ. you re gonna pop a rib. 
morty: thank you for saving us rick! i promise never to question your brilliance ever again. 
rick: good. i m happy to hear that. and as for this little guy. rick pulls the time travel device out of the portal gun and snaps it over his knee. some things are better left unexplored. 
morty: you can say that again. they both have a laugh. 
rick: what do you say we get out of here and grab some ice cream? 
morty: that sounds perfect, rick. rick puts his arm around morty as they exit the garage and head out into the sunny afternoon. 
rick: out of curiosity, what made you want to go back in time in the first place? 
morty: (uncomfortably) oh, uhh, nothing. it wasn t important. just thought it d be fun to check out... 
rick: not sure i believe that answer, but i ll accept it this time. morty takes a sigh of relief as they walk off into the distance. 
[int. classroom - day] 
morty sits at his desk, staring at jessica from across the room. he fantasizes about her while mr. goldenfold teaches class. 
mr.  goldenfold: now, does anybody know what the square root of 144 is? he looks around the room. morty, what about you? morty doesn t realize he s been called upon. morty! are you listening to me? morty snaps out of it and attempts to collect himself. 
morty: uhhh, yeah, i m listening. what s up? 
mr.  goldenfold: the question, do you have an answer? 
morty: uhhh, yes. i mean, maybe... what was the question? the class starts laughing at him. 
mr.  goldenfold: morty, i need you to be awake for my class if you plan on passing. how about we do a little mid day stretch to wake you up. 
morty: (mortified) uhh, no, i m alright. i m awake, i promise. 
mr.  goldenfold: nope, not good enough morty, i need you to stand up and stretch. lift those arms as high as you can. 
morty: no, really, i m ok. 
mr.  goldenfold: i m not starting the lecture back up until you stretch. morty, panicking, looks around the room at all the eyes staring back at him. 
morty: uhhhh, ok... he slowly stands up with his eyes closed and stretches his arms, praying nobody sees his erection. the other students notice right away and laugh. 
brad: oh snap! morty s bustin a chub! jessica points and laughs. 
mr.  goldenfold:.... you may sit down morty. morty slowly sinks into his chair. 
morty enters the living room. rick is sitting on the couch with summer. 
rick: you re really killing me with all this homework morty. 
morty: it would go quicker if you helped me, rick. 
rick: i had to burp-wait here all day with your sister watching reruns of friends. do you, do you know how inconsiderate that is? 
summer: nobody was making you. 
rick: that s not true summer, i-i-i came in, i came in and said"where s morty? i got experiments to run"remember? 
summer: right. and then you said, is that friends? 
rick: no, then you started pulling that"i didn t even get a birthday card"card like a teen-burp-age girl. 
summer: shut up! can we just go back to watching friends. 
morty: oh, i like that show. can we do that? 
rick: these aren t even new episodes. 
summer: none of them are new. all we can do is watch reruns. 
rick: your school is failing you, summer, anything is possible. you think we can t find a way to make new friends? 
summer: oh, yeah! we can go back to when they finished filming and pay them to keep making episodes. 
rick: that s a terrible plan. what, we do that, then they pump out a few more episodes with worn out writers and overpaid actors walking through scenes? no thank you. if we do this, we burp do this right. jerry and beth enter holding a cake that reads"happy birthday summer, go get it girl!"as rick, morty and summer go through a portal. 
jerry: happy birthday to... 
beth: summer? 
jerry: did they leave? 
beth: morty? 
jerry: oh, do you think she saw the cake and got upset? 
beth: please, jerry, the cake is fine jerry. they go back into the kitchen as rick, morty and summer come through a portal. they are wearing togas. 
toga rick: this is dimension 34rth. not to be confused with the 34th dimension, though the two are similar. 
toga summer: we re in a different dimension? 
rick: it is nearly identical to our universe but they have totally different religious principals, so it s friends but with totally different b plots. like the butterfly effect. 
toga morty: leo is in this? 
toga rick: no, just a small difference in the past can change everything. maybe you don t ask such stupid questions in another dimension. something as big as religion could lead to millions of differences, including new episodes of friends. 
toga summer: yes! jerry and beth reenter without the cake. 
jerry: oh summer, there you are. i ll go get the cake. why are you all wearing togas? 
beth: are we having a party? 
toga summer: no, there s no party, i ll explain all that later. i just want to watch friends right now. 
jerry: summer, sweetie, i know it s your birthday and you get whatever you want, but that doesn t mean you get to be rude. 
toga summer: shut up! i m watching friends. summer focuses on the tv. 
toga summer: i m watching friends. title sequence 
[int. jerry’s house.] 
rick, morty and summer step through a portal. they are not wearing togas. 
rick: this is dimension tog-4. 
summer: we re in a different dimension? 
rick: it is nearly identical to our universe but they believed completely different religions through out history, so it s friends has totally different b plots. the butterfly effect. 
morty: ashton is in this? 
rick: no, just a small difference in the past can change everything. here, ashton burp-kutcher is a hideously ugly senator. they had to totally rewrite the butterfly effect. something as big as religion could lead to millions of differences, including new episodes of friends. 
summer: hell yeah! but boo about that ashton thing. 
morty: so because the butterfly effect was better, friends is too? 
rick: different, i didn t say better. that movie was underated, even with it s flaws. but yeah, when they got rid of it s burp-biggest flaw and hired leo instead, different became better. 
morty: so how is it different on friends? 
rick: in this reality greek mythology is real. 
summer: wait, what? 
rick: i-i-it s so much burp. 
rick: much better if you just don t ask questions. y-y-you wanted new episodes of friends, this is as close as i can get you? 
summer: what? 
ricky: jesus, you re worse than morty. 
morty: alright! 
ricky: i-i-i took us to a different dimension where all of greek mythology is true, zeus, ti-burp-titans all of it. it all happened and is still happening. a-a-and in all the infinite universes, there was one where greek mythology is real and they also happened to create the show friends. friends starts playing on the television. 
summer: oh my god it s friends. and they re wearing togas! 
ricky: yeah i know. everything s different here. even things that are burp the same are different. jerry and beth reenter without the cake but wearing togas. 
jerry: oh summer, there you are. i ll go get the cake. why aren t you wearing togas? 
beth: are we having a party? 
summer: no, there s no party, i ll explain all that later. i just want to watch friends right now. 
jerry: summer, sweetie, i know it s your birthday and you get whatever you want, but that doesn t mean you get to be rude. 
summer: shut up! i m watching friends. summer focuses on the tv. 
summer: i m watching friends. friends but greek mythology theme 
[int. coffee house] 
monica, rachel, ross, chandler and phoebe sit around the coffee shop. 
monica: we can t not tell joey. 
ross: i don t know, monica, i would want to know. 
monica: right. 
ross: oh, i got confused with the double nega.. and no, we can t not tell him. 
rachel: we can t tell him, the power would go to his head. 
monica: what s the worst that could happen, rachel? 
rachel: he could make us start going to those stupid satyr plays he s in. 
ross: i mean, how could you though? 
chandler:"hey dude, you ve accidently completed three of the 12 sacred trials and are well on your way to becoming a demi-god. so where s the rent?" 
[int. jerry’s kitchen] 
jerry has scraped te icing off the top of the cake. 
beth: jerry, what did you do? 
jerry: i thought of something better, so i went and bought some more icing. 
beth  (reading the cake) :"hpy bday smr"smr? 
jerry: it s text speak. she s always texting, i thought i d text her a happy birthday. on a cake. 
beth: but you only decorated a quarter of it. 
jerry: ok, i ran out of icing again. 
beth: how d you run out of icing? jerry grabs his keys angrilly and goes to the door. 
jerry: nobody mocked da vinci because he wanted to get it right beth. 
[int. coffee shop] 
ross: so we agree, we tell him. 
phoebee: i still say no. if he knows he could become a god, he d end up massacring an entire island in greece, he s that type of person. 
monica: oh phoebee, enough with all of your prophecies. 
rachel: you do go on and on with those, but how many are ever even right? 
phoebee: all of them. 
chandler: yeah, but how many do we actually listen to? 
phoebee: like none of them. 
chandler: exactly, obviously you aren t a very good prophet. joey enters. 
joey: you will not believe what just happened! 
all: joey! hey! hi! 
joey: yeah, yeah, yeah, you will not believe what just happened! 
ross: you slay another big monster on your way home? 
joey: no better, i got a part. i m scott summer in the remake of cyclops. 
monica: oh, that s another one of those satyr plays isn t it. 
joey: it s the satyr play! 
[int. jerry’s house] 
rick and morty and summer sit on the couch watching friends. 
morty: happy birthday summer. 
rick: oh yeah, happy birthday. 
summer: shhh. shh. shhh. shh. shhhh. 
[int. jerry’s kitchen] 
jerry stands stupidly while beth does the dishes. 
jerry: all they ve done all day is watch that stupid show. 
beth: at least they re watching it together. 
jerry: it s not like they re talking though, they re just all staring at the same thing. they could be in here, eating cake with us. 
beth: jesus jerry would, you drop it with the cake thing. the cake now reads"keep on killing it summer! happy birthday"is shown 
jerry: what? i fixed it. it s no longer just a sentence. 
beth: stop bringing up the cake. 
jerry: oh, this one isn t gooed enough either is it. 
beth: i think it s fine. just stop worrying about it, would you? 
jerry: i can t! i can t get the wording right. what do 17 year olds say? 
summer  (os) : shut up! please! quiet! we re trying to watch friends! 
[ext. creek new york daylight] 
joey is dressed as cyclops from x-men while everyone around him is dressed as lewd and grotesque satyrs. he talks with chandler. 
chandler: surprisingly not awful. joey doesn t remove is cyclops mask. 
joey: you know thank you. a goddess approaches. 
chandler: well screw my goat, artemis. 
artemis: i m sorry? 
chandler: i mean, screw my goat, artemis. joey takes off his mask. 
artemis: joey. you were wonderful tonight. 
joey: thank you, artemis! i m a big fan of your work too! i think you re wonderful every night. 
[int. jerry’s house.] 
summer is glued to the tv. 
summer: this is unbelievable rick. 
rick: there s a bunch of other cool things i could show you in this universe too. 
morty: hey guys, whats... 
summer: quiet! i didn t mean for anyone else to start talking. 
[int. coffee shop] 
ross and rachel share coffee. 
rachel: you guys are blowing this out of proportion. 
ross: he s knocked out another one of the trials. we can t just keep ignoring this. 
rachel: oh, he knows what he s doing. 
ross: no, he doesn t! he doesn t know anything. 
rachel: well... 
ross: at all.. 
rachel: yeah, but... 
ross: about anything. 
rachel: i think he d make a good god. ross notices someone. 
ross: zeus me, is that... nope never mind. 
rachel: what who is it? 
ross: it s no one, it s nothing. 
rachel: no, tell me. rachel looks and sees him. 
rachel: it s cupid! 
ross: like the"femi-wuhhhh"cupid? 
rachel: yes, by gods, it s him! 
ross: you don t think.. 
rachel: what? oh. oh! oh. you think? 
ross: i don t know. 
rachel: huh. 
ross: i mean, i m sure gods just need a cup of coffee too. 
rachel: maybe. it s weird though. 
ross: what s that? 
rachel  (v. o.) : blank stares from rick and morty and summer. i mean, how often is it ever just us two together and then for the first time since i ve been here this coffee shop has had cupid stop by. back to the show. 
ross: you think it s a sign? 
rachel: maybe. maybe i don t know. maybe we should see what happens? the entire group enters loudly interrupting the mood. 
joey: i have been pretty awesome lately. 
chandler: nothing is topping when you killed that nemean lion that was dating monica. 
monica: can we let that go? 
phoebe: oh my god, it s cupid! 
rachel and ross: what?! no way?! where? 
chandler: oh, would you"femi-wuhhh"that. monica slaps chandler on the shoulder. 
monica: what do you think it means? 
ross: (connecting to rachel) maybe it s just a reminder that you will one day find that right person. 
monica: aw, that d be nice. 
chandler: (looking at monica) or that he was there all along. 
phoebe: or that sometimes cupid s getting coffee so you gotta do it yourself. phoebe approaches cupid. 
joey: i think it means i should ask artemis out. 
[int. jerry’s house.] 
rick: i ve already seen this one summer, so if i could go with morty... 
summer: rick, we are spending family time together. and i m not watching friends by myself. 
rick: seriously, i-i-i got a lot of burp things i could be doing right now. 
summer: it s my birthday! you were gone for the other 364 days of the year, but damnit you will be here today! 
rick: summer i though by now y-y-you d see that time is relative. and my time compared to yours is far more valuable. but burp fine, it s probably at about the ratio of your entire life to this afternoon, so i ll give you two more episodes. 
summer: good. 
rick: but you know, i don t think i m getting enough credit for spending this much time with you. i came over to get morty for important science stuff. i changed my plans today for you and it feels like you are taking that for granted. 
summer: thanks rick. maybe you can even stick around for three. 
rick: gonna be honest, depends on the episode. i won t watch anything with medusa in it. 
[int. nice restaurant] 
ross and rachel share a very nice greek romantic dinner. 
ross: i think this is good. 
rachel: so far it s not bad. 
ross: i mean, i don t know what i expected. 
rachel: oh no. 
ross: i guess that. 
rachel: no, that s joey and artemis over there? 
ross: oh, right. 
rachel: look at how this whole restaurant shuts down for her. 
ross: wow they really do. half the restaurant is worshipping artemis. 
rachel: must be nice to date a god my zeus. 
ross: right. 
rachel: but they can be such ungodly pricks, you know? 
ross: never met one actually. 
rachel: oh really? 
ross: no, have you? 
rachel: uhh, yeah. i dated one actually. 
ross: wait, you dated a god? which one? 
rachel: oh, that doesn t matter. oh no, they re coming over here. 
ross: wait. what? 
[int. jerry’s kitchen] 
jerry: i could go to the store real quick and get more icing. 
beth: stop. just stop. they are silent for a beat. 
[int. nice restaurant] 
joey and artemis arrive. 
joey: artemis, these are my good friends ross and 
artemis: rachel, i ve heard about you. apollo sends his regards. 
joey: you know apollo?! 
ross: apollo. fantastic. tell him i send my regards. 
artemis: if you wish, but i doubt he s heard of you. i don t think he fraternizes with many men. i ll put in your word, though, see what happens. 
joey: nice! 
ross: right. well, as i was saying rachel, that thing with work came up so i really gotta go. 
artemis: if you d like i could have people take care of that for you. 
rachel: see. look at that ross, you don t have to go. really. 
ross: no really, i should go. i have a lot to do. thank you anyways, artemis, i ll keep my regards i think, but it was lovely to meet you. ross leaves. 
rachel: i should go, too. nice meeting you artemis. 
artemis: likewise, you live up to your reputation, beautiful rachel. 
rachel: oh. well, thank you. i think. rachel leaves. 
joey: what just happened. 
artemis: i m sorry joey, when i m around sometimes i drive people away. 
joey: oh, hey arty-baby, don t get sad. i m still here. let s go have a nice romantic meal, we can order lambs, i know how much you like them. 
artemis: they do have the best lambs here. 
joey: who needs anyone else tonight anyways? 
[int. jerry’s house.] 
a second rick, morty and summer enter from outside. both summers scream. 
toga rick: what s going on? 
rick: summer wanted new episodes of friends. 
toga summer: you can do that? 
rick: oh yeah, there s an infinite number of dimensions, all with slightly different episodes of friends. 
toga summer: oh rick! please! 
toga rick: i ll remember this rick. i want you to know that. what you just did right here, right now, in this dimension. i will always remember this, rick. 
toga summer: it s my birthday, please! can we go!? rick drinks from the bottle as toga rick drinks from the bottle. toga rick, toga morty and toga summer leave through a portal. 
rick: bye, lame rick. 
summer: everybody shut up! rick drinks. 
[int. monica’s apartment] 
monica and rachel sit on the couch. 
monica: why would you say that!? 
rachel: i don t know, it just came out. 
monica: how did you expect him to react? 
rachel: i don t know. not like that. 
monica: even if you re confidant getting compared to, literally, a god. 
rachel: i know. 
monica: i mean how would someone compare to a god. 
rachel: oh you don t want to know. 
monica: i kinda do. 
rachel: well, depends in what way? 
monica: come on rachel tell me about that godly sex! 
rachel: oh, well... not as good as you might imagine. he was just kind of a goat the entire time. 
monica: he what? 
rachel: god s are weird. they re into weird things. 
monica: he what? 
rachel: i don t think joey knows what he s getting himself into. 
monica: apollo had sex with you while he was a goat? 
[int. jerry’s house.] 
summer: this isn t friends! ew rick! 
morty: what does she mean rick? 
rick: what, you re losing interest just because it s j-j-just getting good? the other toga rick, toga morty and toga summer come through the portal. 
toga summer: that was awful! 
toga rick: yeah, what the hell was that rick? 
rick: sorry, probably should have warned you, our friends is the worst one by far. 
summer: shut up! all of you! i m going home! summer grabs the gun, shoots a portal and runs through. 
rick: do you mind if i borrow your dimension gun thingy? i don t have a spare. toga rick hands him his dimension jumping gun. 
toga rick: bring it back when you re done. 
rick: right. rick and morty go through the portal. 
rick: dumbass. he s never getting this back. 
morty: rick. what was that? 
rick: hey, another version of me stole my spare, i m just paying it forward. 
morty: no not that. 
rick: what do you me-burp-mean? 
morty: what just happened. all that. what was that? 
rick: it was friends morty, but if it was written in a world where greek mythology was the ruling frammework for how things worked. what didn t you get about that? 
morty: i get all that. but. but why would you think that was something we wanted to see. 
rick: it s not about what you wanted to see. it s about burp what you needed to see morty. 
morty: i didn t need to see that. 
rick: then learn morty. it was so you could learn things. or whatever. 
toga morty: so what did i learn rick? 
rick: i have to spell everything out for you morty. it means that in some dimension, in some universe, jennifer anniston took some goat dick. so you can do anything rick. there are no rules. 
morty: rick, we play with time and science. not religion. 
rick: wow, gotta say, morty, i m impressed. i didn t think you d pick up on that. 
morty: so what the fuck was that? why was greek mythology real? 
rick: okay, so greek mythology wasn t really real there, it was just a dimension where somebody thought it would be a good idea to make friends intertwined with greek mythology. that was the only thing that was really different about the universes. 
morty: but that means 
rick: i know. we don t have concrete proof jennifer anniston took some goat dick. and u-u-unfortunately ashton is burp just as good looking but i d still like to believe, morty. because for some reason he wasn t in the butterfly effect in that dimension. and that s something. that s burp-enough for me. 
morty: but why were my parents wearing togas? 
rick: do you know how awesome friends is when combined with greek mythology? it s perfect storytelling, morty, it was very influential. 
[int. jerry’s kitchen] 
summer enters, jerry and beth are at the table. the cake reads "happy birthday summer!!" summer sees the cake and smiles. 
summer: you made me a cake? 
jerry: uh, yeah. do you like it? 
summer: i love it. thank you daddy. jerry beams. 
beth: i told you it was fine, jerry. rick is passing by. 
rick: that s really something to burp strive for, there. aw, did morty bake you a cake? he s a sweet kid, you know? 
[ext. beautiful beach - day] 
morty appears relaxed for once. he sits on a beautiful beach wearing swim trunks. a variety of alien species lounge and play all along the shore. morty is looking out at the water while rick collects some water samples. 
morty: damn rick! that sun, man. feeels good! morty runs his hand through the sand, scooping it up and letting it fall through his fingers. he scoops up another handful and admires it, inspecting the grains closer this time. 
rick: ohh i feel it, morty! what'd i tell you, this really is the best-we zoom in on the sand. the grains are made of tiny living sand creatures and they're freaking out!! morty screams, shaking them out of his hand. 
morty: what the hell, rick! what's wrong with this sand?! 
rick: it's fine, morty, that's just how sand is on beach planet. other than contributing to the systemic destruction of a species every time you take a step, it's the best beach in the galaxy! morty's eyes widen with the realization he is sitting on billions of living creatures. he jumps to his feet. 
morty: oh my god!! oh jeez, i'm sorry! how am i suppose to enjoy this!? i'm killing people, rick! 
rick: killing people on the beach is an american pastime! remember jaws, morty? besides--rick wiggles his toes in the sand."morty hears a what?" they feel so good between your toes, hahaha. morty covers his eyes. 
morty: you're messed up, rick! you know that?! you're a real sick guy. i can't deal with it anymore! 
rick: christ, morty, okay. it's about time we head out anyways, i've finished testing the water's pee levels. 
morty: (disgusted) pee levels?! 
rick: yeah, they're off the charts. let's get out of here. rick gets up and heads towards the ship. 
morty: this whole place is screwed up! morty mumbles angrily as he does a weird tip toe, big step walk, avoiding contact with the sand as much as possible. he reaches the grass and looks at the other people on the beach. he sees some alien bullies stomp on a sand castle. a dog-like creature kicks up sand as he digs holes. a child shoves a handful of sand into its slobbering mouth. he points out at everyone on the beach. 
morty: you're all screwed up! morty groans. he scoops up another handful of sand and somberly watches as they freak out. he looks around and puts a small amount of sand into one of rick's empty sample containers. he runs to catch up with rick. 
rick: make sure you brush off before you get in, i don't want my ship full of sand, you know how hard it is to get that shit out once it gets in? 
[int. smith household living room - day] 
beth is sitting at the computer looking up exotic vacations. jerry flips through the newspaper. summer is lounging on the couch, texting. rick and morty enter through the front door, beach towels in hand. 
rick: (sarcastic) oh boy, what is this? some kind of party? jerry looks up from the paper. 
rick: jesus, you guys are pathetic. just content to sit inside allll day. and i'm not just saying that like a baby boomer would say to millennials. you guys are actually boring. 
jerry: well, so what? we have everything we need right here. i've got the tv remote, the paper, and all the ice pops i can enjoy. what more can a man ask for? jerry takes a slurp of an ice pop. while they're talking, morty inconspicuously sneaks away. he trips on the carpet on his way up the stairs. 
beth: he's right, jerry. it has been a while since we've had any kind of excitement. i heard zip lining is the new big thing for people who can't handle actual extreme sports. maybe you'd like that. 
jerry: hey, i can handle extreme sports. i'm rad! summer laughs. jerry shoots her a dirty look. summer is now listening intently to the conversation. 
rick: please. zip lining? is that the best you can think of? i've got just the thing for you two kids. 
beth: well, if you can get lame-ass on board, i'm willing to try something new. otherwise, i might just go on one of those solo"self discovery"trips those women's magazines keep talking about. beth exits to the kitchen. 
rick: ohh, ya hear that jerry?"self discovery trip."i wonder what that could mean. have you seen how hot some of those tour guides are? if i were you i wouldn't give her time to think about it. 
summer: jeez, grandpa, why do you have to stir up conflict? (to jerry) but he's totally right. they say boredom is the number one marriage killer, you need to show mom you're wild and unpredictable. 
jerry: everybody just shut up, beth knows i'm a loose cannon. who knows what i might do next? hi-ya! jerry does a karate kick and punches the air. 
rick: you're right jerry, we weren't expecting that. we weren't expecting it to be so lame. rick and summer high five. jerry hangs his head in shame. 
rick: so it's settled, you and beth go get ready. jerry leaves the room, rick takes his seat. 
rick: i've got a little self discovering of my own, summer. self discovering my ass on this seat! 
[int. morty's room - moments later] 
morty pulls the sample dish out of his pocket and brings it over to a vacant gel ant farm on his desk. he gently taps the sand into it. with an expression of curiosity and concern, he grabs a magnifying glass from a drawer and holds it up. the sand people are already up and wandering around their new home. morty watches in wonder. 
[ext. tourist world - day] 
beth and jerry are standing on hover segways, strapping on bicycle helmets. jerry is looking around with amazement. they are with a group of about thirteen other tourists. each of the tourists are a different species of alien. 
beth: are you sure this is safe, dad? 
rick: it's as safe as you want it to be, this is tour-west world! what? beth 
rick: tourist world. jerry starts to take off his helmet. 
rick: jerry! put your helmet back on! (to beth) but yeah, it's fine. 
beth: okay.. well thank you for this whole-rick hands beth the space phone. 
rick: yeah, yeah. call me if you need me. just, you know, try not to need me. rick turns around and walks through an open gate. the gate closes as he walks up to what looks like a ticket booth. 
rick: uhh, two for the romantic getaway please. 
ticket guy: that'll be fifty-three impels. half-off if you show me them dimples. 
rick: i'll uh, i'll just pay full price. 
[int. morty's room - later] 
morty is watching his sand people through a magnifying glass. the sand people have set up an entire community and the population has increased significantly. morty watches as some people shop, others build houses, and one is waving at morty! haha, wow! 
morty: morty waves back, the sand person turns his wave into a middle finger. summer walks by and notices morty waving. 
summer: what are you doing? morty turns around, trying to hide the ant farm. 
morty: what? oh, uh, nothing. summer pushes him out of the way. 
summer: really, morty, ants? you're one of those kids? gross. 
morty: haha yeah, ants. it's gross, go now please. 
summer: just kidding, i love ants. lemme see. 
morty: woah, summer, stop! summer grabs the magnifying glass and looks closer. 
summer: oh my god, what the hell is this? i'm telling grandpa rick before this gets out of control. 
morty: no, summer wait! look at them, they're harmless. 
summer: yeah, but so were your sea monkeys until.. summer shudders. 
morty: i found them on a beach planet. they were being stepped on. i couldn't let them be killed, that's messed up, right summer? 
summer: i mean, sure, i guess they seem fine. but if anything weird happens you better tell grandpa. 
morty: sheesh summer, chill on your mans here, i did a good thing. i know it, you know it, karma knows it. everything will work out. 
summer: okay just tell rick if... 
morty: you do a good thing and good things will happen, ya know? summer leaves without a word. 
morty: if anything bad happens it's probably because your bad karma is blocking out my good karma. 
[ext. tourist planet - day] 
the tourists stroll along a steep cliff overlooking the water. 
tour guide: that'll be all for our mandatory group run down. feel free to explore by yourselves now or stick with me for group exploration. (wink) 
jerry: let's blow this turd stand, beth. we'll never have fun with these squares around.. beth? beth is hover segwaying near the edge of the cliff talking to the beefy buff tour guide. 
tour guide: oh yeah, i've spent many nights out on that beautiful blue water, just staring at the stars, letting all my stress float into deep space like helium balloons.. 
beth: um, okay. i just wanted to know where i could find the restrooms. jerry stares jealously at the tour guide. 
jerry: trying to steal my wife, huh? well, not today. jerry looks at an alien tourist standing next to him. the creature makes a gurgling noise. 
jerry: you're right. jerry confidently moves forward. 
jerry: hey beth, check this out!! jerry attempts an ollie on his hover segway but he's not rad enough to nail it. he loses his balance, causing him to spin out and lurch forward. he bumps the tour guide right off the edge of the cliff. beth is on her way to the bathrooms, paying no attention. 
jerry: oh my god! i.. i oh my god! okay, saw.. it's not a probably happens didn't mean to.. at least nobody big deal, this all the time.. jerry turns around and locks eyes with another tourist. he saw the whole thing. 
[int. control room - day] 
two men wearing lab coats stand around a hologram map of tourist world. a sign on the door reads "master control room." an alert opens up on the map. 
employee 2: sir, we've lost a host in sector a- employee 1 presses a button. jerry is shown on a screen in real time. 
employee 2: what's he doing? i thought they bought the"romantic getaway"package? 
employee 1: probably an accident, maybe a glitch. continue simulation as requested. they watch as jerry grabs the witness and throws him off the cliff. 
employee 1: alright, must be one of those types of couples. just change the settings. employee 2 presses a few buttons and turns up the intensity 
switch. he hesitates over the spider release valve. 
employee 2: give it a rest with the spiders, gordon. 
[int. house/garage - day] 
rick is tinkering with something in his lab. he fidgets uncomfortably in his seat, then goes back to tinkering. he fidgets once more, visibly annoyed. he reaches down the back of his pants to scratch. what the- 
rick: rick takes a close look at his hand, now dotted with grains of sand. 
rick: oh my god, you've gotta be kidding me. morty!! rick storms up the stairs to morty's room. 
[int. morty's room - continuous] 
rick finds a shattered ant farm and pile of sand on morty's desk. morty walks out of the bathroom, drying his hands on his shirt. he sees rick standing in his doorway, fuming. 
rick: exactly what i thought. what the f is this morty? morty sees the broken ant farm for the first time. 
morty: oh jeez, rick! what the heck happened here?! everything was fine, where'd all this extra sand come from? 
rick: are you some kind of tourist now, bringing home sand from the beach? and now i've gotta be the one to clean up your stupid little mess. summer walks in with a posterboard covered in stock pictures of different fingers, titled"evolution of the hand." 
summer: hey, morty, do you have anymore tape i can borrow for my--what's going on in here? 
morty: rick's trying to get rid of my sand people! tell him he's being dick! 
rick: without the harsh beach environment, morty, the sand creatures reproduced and infested this whole place. we have to call in a special cleaning crew to exterminate these awful things. 
summer: cleaning crew? 
rick: yes, cleaning crew, or more of a cleaning man. pretty much the space equivalent of billy mays. you don't expect us to just vacuum this up do you? have you ever tried to vacuum up sand before? it's impossible, you'll never get it all. maybe on a hard wood floor, maybe, but no way, not on carpet! rick pulls out his phone and dials the number for space billy mays. morty smacks the phone right out of his hands. 
morty: no! you can't! i'll fix this rick, i'm not going to let you kill them, it's not fair! they're my responsibility. 
rick: oh, you wanna talk about responsibility? remember what happened to your sea monkeys? 
[int. smith household - kitchen - flashback] 
morty is sitting at the kitchen table, eating breakfast with his family. rick runs in. 
rick: morty check this out! you know your little sea monkeys? well, i gmo'd them up with a little hgh for you. two giant ripped looking sea monkeys step into the kitchen and they don't look happy with morty. 
[int. morty's room - present day -continuous] 
morty: that was your fault rick! 
rick: typical morty, can never take responsibility for his mistakes. 
summer: he's kind of right, grandpa. you can't just get rid of them, they're little lives and they have value just like me or- 
rick: shut it, summer. you can't keep these things, they're pests. the only way would be to shrink down to sand size, gain control of their society to establish a utopia, and stabilize their population to keep them from infesting the house. but that's stupid. 
morty: no, that's what we'll do then! we'll shrink down. rick picks the phone back up. morty smacks it out of his hands again. 
rick: oh you did not-are you serious right now you little bitch?! morty i bet that i can create a utopian sand society before you can! if i win i get to keep them as pets! 
rick: oh my god, i don't have time for this, morty. rick goes to pick up the phone, but morty kicks it out of reach. rick gets in morty s face. 
rick: fine, you're on! but when i win you have to go school wearing sugar coated lip gloss and a lute suit with the butt cheeks cut out, and let me do any experiments i need to do on you for the next 3 weeks! 
morty: uhh... fine, okay, deal. just the last one though. rick spits a gross wad of spit on his palm and shakes morty's hand. 
[ext. tourist planet - day] 
jerry rushes over to beth, he looks very paranoid. 
jerry: beth! we gotta go, we gotta go, now! 
beth: jerry, what's wrong? oh no, did you get your weiner caught in your zipper again? 
jerry: oh god, it's awful beth! 
beth: okay, just calm down. let me see if i can go find some butter. jerry sees a group of officers riding on hover segways in the distance. 
jerry: (hushed) i tried to impress you! i knocked the tour guide off of a cliff! bethwhat? how would that impress me? 
jerry: no! i was trying to do a segway trick! we have to go now! 
beth: jesus, jerry. let's just lay low for now and think of what to do. jerry grabs beth and they ride in the opposite direction of the cops. the segways are ridiculously slow, so they ditch them and head out on foot through a desert like terrain. 
jerry: oh, ow! ouch! my ankle! the segways! i've become accustomed to living in luxury! beth sighs. get on. beth jerry hops on her back. beth piggybacks jerry until they reach 
[ext. a sketchy bar in the middle of nowhere - day] 
jerry: look! we're saved! we can get inside and call rick. there's wanted posters of alien thugs tacked near the door. 
jerry: wow, six-thousand impel reward! i wonder if that's a lot. they walk through the rickety saloon style bar doors. 
[int. bar - day] 
the inside of the bar is just as rough looking as the exterior. it's filled with dozens of tough looking aliens. beth and jerry sit down at the counter. the greasy bartender gives them a mean look. 
jerry: excuse me? two waters please. the bartender slams two shots of brown goo on the counter in front of jerry. jerry looks at the drinks, frustrated. 
jerry: um, hello? wa-ter, i asked for-beth slaps her hand over his mouth, shushing him. 
beth: just be happy and drink your slime before you get us killed. jerry sighs and cautiously lifts the drink to his lips. he barely takes a sip before he starts coughing and sputtering. 
beth: shhh! jerry stop it! jerry flails his arms and knocks over a very tough looking patron s drink. it's one of the aliens from the wanted posters. he s pissed. the tough guy and his two other tough friends stand up menacingly. 
tough alien  1: (angry) my mimosa. beth stands up. 
beth: i am so sorry about that. we both are. let me buy you a new one. beth reaches into her purse and grabs a few dollar bills. tourists.. 
tough alien  2: an alien grabs jerry by his collar and cranks back his fist. 
tough alien  3: tour fists! beth grabs a bottle and smashes it over the alien's head. 
beth: run, jerry! jerry is already running. he dives behind a dumpster next to the bar and peeks out. we see the aliens walk out of the bar holding beth. she struggles to get away. 
jerry: (whispers) if i just stay here, maybe they'll forget about it and let beth go.. 
tough alien  1: (shouting) we're gonna cut off her fingers! 
jerry: beth's a tough lady, she'll figure it out.. how many fingers does she even need? oh, god, what am i saying? that's my wife! a good husband would save his wife! jerry sighs and steps out from behind the dumpster. the goons drop beth and watch as jerry paces towards them. jerry raises his hands fisticuffs style feigning toughness. jerry charges towards them. the goons set beth down, amused. jerry raises his hands fisticuffs style, feigning toughness. 
jerry: let my wife and i go and we won't have any problems. the goons look at each other and chuckle. jerry swings his fist into alien 1's stomach. the alien doesn't flinch. 
[int. control room - day] 
the scientists watch as jerry punches the alien with the strength of a toddler. 
employee 1: let's turn skin density down to seventy-five percent and turn the weight down ten percent. actually, make that twenty percent. yes, sir. 
employee 2: he flips a switch and pulls down a couple of levers. 
[ext. tourist planet/bar - day] 
beth face-palms. the alien bellows with laughter. jerry turns red with embarrassment. he pulls his fist back and launches another punch out of anger. this time the punch sends the alien rocketing backwards. 
jerry: oh my god! beth did you see that? jerry looks at the other aliens with a new confidence. he punches one in its sensitive nipples and kicks the other in his balls. busted up, they lay in a pile on the ground. jerry! 
beth: beth runs to him and they embrace. a shadowy figure appears right behind jerry. beth gasps. the screen goes black. 
[int. smith household living room - day] 
morty carefully spreads out three tiny piles of sand people on the carpet. 
rick: okay, morty, are you sure you wanna go through with this bet? all it takes is one call to space billy mays and this whooole situation is over. rick holds the phone up, ready to dial the number. 
morty: go ahead, rick, call space billy mays. call him and tell him morty says he can shove it! and you know what else? why's there even a space billy mays, how does that even make sense? i mean, are there two billy mays'? what's that all about? rick sighs and sets his phone next to a glass of water on the coffee table. 
rick: okay, everyone get in the ship. the quicker morty learns not to be such a baby, the quicker we can get back. 
[ext. summer's tribe - day] 
summer steps out of the ship into this brand new environment. it's like a forest, but made of carpet fibers. 
summer: why am i even here? 
rick: you wanted to get involved so bad well, here you go, summer! rick and morty take off, leaving summer with a small group of sand people. 
summer: wait! what am i supposed to do with them?! the ship is long gone now. summer looks around awkwardly at her sand people. so.. 
summer: summer looks down at one of the sand people's feet. 
summer: i like your.. shoes.. the sand person looks down at his own feet and makes a weird face. his feet are just really dirty. 
summer: oh. i guess i'm supposed to like, help you guys live better. let's start with a makeover, you're all really naked. 
[int. ship - day] 
rick and morty fly over morty’s tribe of about three-hundred sand people. naturally, they've already begun construction on homes. 
morty: wow, look at them go. this isn't gonna be so hard. rick scoffs. 
rick: that's what you think. i can't wait to see you fail miserably. you'll be like,"oh darn, guess i should've listened to my genius grandpa instead of being a gigantic piss baby about everything all the time."do you even have a game plan, morty? 
morty: easy. i'm just going to change the things that nobody likes about our society and just like, ya know, make sure everybody is cool. everybody does their share and gets treated equally, nobody goes without, and no more pizza nights at the gym. people are there to lose weight, why have the unnecessary temptation? rick yawns. 
rick: wow, are you done? 
morty: yeah, rick, i guess i-rick hands morty a jet pack. get out. 
rick: morty steps out and rick takes off. 
[ext. ricks sand tribe - day] 
rick lands his ship and steps outside, wearing a jet pack. his sand people surround him, awestruck. rick clears his throat. 
rick: riiiiiiiiick!!!! the sand people look around for a moment before erupting with a cheer. 
sand people: (collectively) riiiiiiiiick!!!! 
[ext. morty's sand city - day] 
morty uses his jet pack to hover above a crowd of sand people. 
morty: alright, listen up guys! we've got a lot of work to do, but i really think if we just come together and stay focused, we can make this place really good. nobody is paying any attention to morty shouting down from the sky. he flies over to a construction zone to see if he can get the workers'attention. 
morty: hey guys! men! i just need your attention for a moment. the workers glance up but then continue to ignore him. morty lands on top of an unfinished building. he knocks over some raw building material. long metal poles roll off the roof, gruesomely impaling one of the workers below. all eyes are on morty. 
[int. bar - day] 
bags are removed from beth and jerry's heads. they're back in the bar and tied to some chairs now. 
beth: why'd you put the bags over our heads? we know exactly where we are! a big fat alien in a suit steps out of the shadows. 
xanbulon carlo: let me introduce myself, the name's xanbulon carlo. i like what you two got, i can tell you guy's have some serious experience on the streets. beth and jerry give each other a funny look. yes.. jerry 
xanbulon carlo: you see, i could use your guys'help. i guess you could say my goons are pretty frickin'retarded, so i need somebody to keep them in check, an assistant crime manager, if you will. 
beth: look, we'd love to help, but we have to go. xanbulon holds up western style wanted posters with beth and jerry's faces on it. 
xanbulon carlo: i'm not asking. jerry scoffs. 
jerry: we're not afraid of your paper cuts! xanbulon looks at beth, confused. beth shrugs. 
xanbulon carlo: if you don't help, i'll turn you in for the reward money, or just kill you. xanbulon takes the space phone from beth's purse. 
xanbulon carlo: and i'll take this, just in case you get any funny ideas. i'll let you two talk this over, i have a phone call to make. xanbulon walks off screen. 
jerry: what're we gonna do!? 
beth: let's just wait it out for now and try to get the phone back. 
jerry: but, what if we're not cut out for this beth, what if- 
beth: look at me, jerry. you saved us back there. you're better than you give yourself credit for, than either of us give you credit for. we'll be okay. xanbulon is getting pretty heated on the phone now. 
xanbulon carlo  (o. s.) : he what!? okay, okay, we'll be ready. 
beth: what's going on? suddenly a wounded gang member is rushed into the bar by another member. xanbulon panics. 
xanbulon carlo: oh no, not wittle winks! what happened?! 
other member: (whispers) he was shot with a laser pistol while fleeing from a robbery, it's not good.. 
wittle winks: d-don't worry, boss. (cough) i'm alright. just a little flesh wound. i-i'll be ok. wittle winks gives a slow, pained wink. xanbulon lifts his shirt revealing a hole in his abdomen oozing green puss. beth jumps into action. 
beth: he's bleeding out. 
jerry: if you can call that blood. 
beth: i think i can help. get a bottle of vodka, some rags, a needle, and suture thread, stat! xanbulon is surprised but not knowing else what to do, unties her and sends the goons to get the requested materials. 
jerry: are you sure, beth? these are strange alien creatures. you're only a horse surgeon! beth glares at jerry who shuts up immediately. 
[ext. morty's sand city - day] 
morty wipes the sweat from his brow. 
morty: wow, all this in only three hours! we got off to a bit of rough start there for a minute, but this is really starting to work out. an amputee sand person hobbles by on crutches. it's the one morty accidentally impaled earlier. morty gives him the thumbs up. 
morty: lookin'good! the city looks peaceful. we see all types of sand people walking around happily. a woman's scream pierces the air. morty turns to look and sees a man snatching a woman's purse. morty jumps into action, chasing him down an alley. the perpetrator opens up the purse and digs around. he pulls out used tissues and furiously shoves them in his mouth. 
morty: hey! hey, stop that! the sand thief burps up tissue pieces. 
[int. mortys sand city/jail - moments later] 
morty shoves the tissue eater into an already packed jail cell. the inmates shout at morty as he walks by. 
inmate: morty! morty, look at me! the inmate pulls off his trench coat, flashing morty. morty shields his eyes. 
inmate  2: morty, you suck! 
inmate  3: morty's gay! morty's gay! one scary looking inmate reaches his arm through the bar and grabs morty's shirt. morty jerks away, ripping the shirt. he rushes out of the jail and takes a deep breath, he's shaking and sweaty. 
morty: oh god, i can't keep doing this, i need help. 
[ext. summer's tribe - day] 
summer is sitting indian style in a circle with her sand people, they all look like hippies now. a young adult sand hippie is speaking. 
existential sand hippie: it's like... it's like, i feel so small, you know? it's like the universe is just so.. big. how could i possibly make any impact? 
summer: i know how you're feeling. it doesn't matter what your shape or size, everyone has the ability to make an impact, just practice what you preach and be yourself. 
identity crisis sand hippie: but who am i? what makes me... me? summer scratches her head unsure. 
summer: i have an idea! let's all go on one of those self discovery journeys i read about in my mom's magazines. if it works for women in unsatisfying marriages, it'll work for you guys. we can go on a hike! they all nod in agreement and set off on a hike. 
[ext. morty's sand city - day] 
morty marches through town square with an intimidating army of buff sand men in uniform. things seem a little darker now. there are noticeably less citizens walking the streets and the ones who are out seem more uptight than before. 
morty: the city seems way safer now, huh guys? i bet we're pretty close to utopia now! morty spots a citizen spray painting anti-morty graffiti on a wall. morty is furious. 
morty: hey! grab him! an officer grabs the citizen. 
morty: what is this? after all i've done for you people?! you know what, i'm done being mister nice guy. you've done it now. throw him in jail! 
officer  1: sir, all the jails are full. 
[int. ricks utopia - day] 
rick rolls up his sleeve and checks his watch. 
rick: alllright, utopia achieved, congrats rick. rick rolls up his sleeve and checks his other watch. he has two watches. 
rick: well, look at that, it's time to rub it in morty's face. rick flies over to morty's city. the sky is full of smog and the grounds are littered with propaganda and garbage. rick sees a line of sand people marching as far as the eyes can see. he follows their path to a gigantic wall. morty is hovering above it, directing the sand people to the other side. he's all sweaty and looks like a sad, gross politician. rick lands his ship and jet packs over to morty. 
[ext. morty's sand city/wall - day] 
rick: what do you got going on here, morty? 
morty: oh, hey uhhh.. rick. pretty uh, pretty close to winning the bet. what do you think of that? rick watches as the sand people walk in a single file line to a small opening in the wall where they crouch down and crawl through. 
rick: wow. well, you can stop now because i already won the bet. 
morty: what? how!? how did you do it?! one of the sand people hesitates before crawling through the wall. 
morty: hey! keep moving you little piece of trash! go! the sand guy rushes through the opening. 
rick: get in the ship morty, i'll show you. 
[int. bar - day] 
beth and jerry are lounging in the bar, decked out in jewelry and bandannas. they look like hardened criminal thugs now. jerry slams a shot of brown goo. there are two, two headed pit bulls sitting at his feet. beth is counting out a stack of alien cash, she spins around in her spinny chair and looks at xanbulon. 
beth: you're short, where's the rest of the money? 
xanbulon carlo: let's just call it an"i'm the boss and you work for me"tax. 
jerry: what? how's that fair?! we've been pulling all the weight here for at least like-jerry counts his fingers 
jerry: four hours! 
xanbulon carlo: yeah, well, rules is rules, pal. 
beth: well.. we wouldn't be here if we followed the rules. beth gives jerry a nod. jerry stands up and pounds his fist in his hand. xanbulon flinches. 
xanbulon carlo: hey, hey, i'm joking. haha... (whispers) jerks.. he throws beth and jerry the rest of the money and walks away. 
beth: hahaha, i haven't had this much fun in a while. this is exactly the exciting adventure i needed.. as weird as that sounds. 
jerry: yeah this is great, who knew we were such badasses! one of the two headed pit bulls moves a little. jerry cautiously moves his feet onto the chair. 
[ext. rick's utopia - day] 
rick and morty are hovering above the utopia. morty sees the sand people running back and forth in bee suits, pressing buttons and pulling levers. 
morty: what the hell is this, rick?! 
rick: have a seat morty, the process will be explained. rick presses a button in his ship and a projector pops out. a black and white education video starts to project onto a building wall. it begins with a title card reading"the sanchez way to a perfect, utopian society." 
narrator: oh, boy! happy citizens ready for their first day of work! let's take a closer look, shall we? we see a line of naked, slightly lighter colored sand people waiting in line. they look fresh and vibrant. 
narrator: fresh sand citizens line up to receive their adorable work suits and begin the first day of their new lifelong duty. this is the beginning of a beautiful cycle of work and reward. morty interrupts. 
morty: why the bee suits, rick?! what's the point of that?! 
rick: because it's funny! 
morty: you can't just force a society to work for their whole lives with no breaks, rick! 
rick: shut up, morty, just keep watching. 
narrator: after a long session of labor, the citizens are rewarded with a heaping helping of honey, spewing directly into their mouths to ensure that they immediately feel rewarded and satisfied. if the rewards aren't enough to keep the citizens hard at work, then you bet the constant fear of impending doom will! morty grabs rick's remote and pauses the video. 
morty: this is stupid! enough with the video, rick! 
rick: you're stupid! you're going to miss the best part, haha. i told them there's a big smelly sand giant in the sky waiting to drag them into a sandy hell and rape their butts with a molten hot fire poker until their insides turn to glass. if those buttons aren't pushed and those switches aren't switched quick enough, he's coming to get'em. it's all in the scripture. rick presses the remote and the screen shows a biblical style drawing of a giant, ugly morty, angrily looking over working sand people in bee suits. 
morty: aw, c'mon rick, you didn't have to make him look like me! and all that work they're doing is for nothing? 
rick: of course not. rick points to a conveyor belt attached to one of the machines. 
rick: the work creates more bee suits and honey! it's a flawless cycle! 
[ext. carpet wilderness - day] 
summer and her hippies trek through some carpet wilderness. they are all wearing backpacks and eating trail mix as they hike. summer pushes apart some fibers revealing a city. 
[ext. morty's city - continuous] 
summer: what in the.. it's a complete ghost town. summer lifts a torn poster on a building wall showing morty's face. the poster reads big morty is watching . she picks up a newspaper from the ground and reads in today's news, morty is generously forcing everyone into a high population, walled off district. what a great guy, so smart. 
summer: oh, god. morty is a huge a-hole. 
sand person: summer? what is this? 
sand person  2: i'm scared.. 
summer: i guess this is my brother's idea of a perfect society. we need to go find him and kick his ass. they wander a few blocks through the dystopian city until they reach a gigantic wall. the sand people look defeated and tired. summer and her hippies approach the line. 
summer: what's going on? did morty really do this? the citizen looks around confused before deciding this must be some kind of test. 
citizen: oh, yeah! morty's the best! (looking up at the sky) thank you, morty!! love you, boy! summer s people are walking person to person hugging them and introducing themselves. one of summer's sand hippies suddenly starts pounding on the wall. 
scared sand hippie: hellllppp!!! help me! 
summer: what! what's wrong!? 
scared sand hippie: we're trapped! we're trapped behind the wall! let us out! summer's sand hippies look concerned. 
summer: wha-no, wait, we're not the ones behind the wa-all the sand hippies start throwing themselves at the wall. 
sand hippies: let us out! let us out! 
existential sand hippie: everyone deserves to thrive! it doesn't matter what your shape or size!! existential sand hippie winks and gives summer a thumbs up. the sand people decide they like this and all begin to chant. morty's people start to protest now too. 
summer: stop! you guys! summer has lost control of the situation. it's escalating into a full blown riot. the wall is being beaten on from both sides, a huge crack rips across the surface. 
summer: morty!!!? rick?! she runs towards the inner city. 
[int. bar - day] 
xanbulon paces into the bar and starts to grab random knick knacks. 
beth: hey, what's the rush? 
jerry: yeah, slow down, take a seat. you're stressing me out. xanbulon tries to ignore them, but jerry stops him in the doorway like an abusive husband would with his wife. sirens start to wail and helicopters are heard outside of the bar. beth and jerry look at xanbulon suspiciously. 
xanbulon carlo: you guys-you guys have turned into some real xanborgs! i can't take it anymore, i turned you in for the reward money. 
jerry: you little..

jerry: we have a hostage! don't shoot! a bullet immediately goes through xanbulons head. beth screams. 
officer on megaphone: he was also wanted! jerry is covered in chunks of gross red and green guts. 
jerry: shoot, shoot, shoot! what are we gonna do, beth?! 
beth: the phone! check his pockets! jerry rifles through xanbulon's pockets and fumbles with the phone. he hands it to beth. she dials rick's number. 
[ext. ricks utopia - day] 
a huge deafening boom shakes the ground what the-rick 
morty: what's going on rick! the ground shakes so hard that rick s bee suit machines stop working. the honey no longer flows. the workers freeze with uncertainty and terror. 
bee sand person: it's happening!!! the workers run around frantically. some rip off their bee suits, others run around, desperately pulling levers and pushing buttons while crying. 
rick: we have to go, now! rick and morty rush into the ship. sand people start to throw themselves on top of it. 
morty: go rick! go! they take off and head towards morty's city. 
[int. ship - moments later] 
morty: what the heck was that? 
rick: i don't know, morty, but i'm willing to bet it was your fault. we have to find summer and get out of here. they arrive at morty's city. it's in an even more severe state of disarray than before. sand people are piling up on both sides of the wall, tearing at it. 
morty: look rick, summer, right over there! 
rick: what's she doing? summer is standing still looking towards the sky. a shadow begins to swallow the city. rick and morty look up. a silhouette of a cell phone and a glass of water are rumbling off the edge of the living room table. 
morty: oh jeez, she's just standing there! summer! she doesn't see us! 
rick: we gotta land the ship, we can't go down there and risk the ship being piled on. we'll use the jetpacks. they land the ship a distance away from the chaos and get out. 
[ext. morty's sand city - moments later] 
rick: morty, go calm down your sand people. i'll go get summer. morty flies above the wall. 
morty: hey, come on, guys, calm down! you're all being really nuts right now! some sand people on the ground look up angrily at him. 
sand people: morty's a fraud! get him, kill him! the earth quakes once more. the crack deepens and the wall crumbles dramatically. millions of sand people spill out. we zoom out to 
[int. smith household living room - continuous] 
rick's phone and a glass of water are on the very edge of the table. a final vibration causes the glass to start to fall over the edge. the phone says one missed call. we zoom in 
[ext. morty's sand city - continuous] 
the giant, falling wave of sand people grab at morty's legs and pull him down. they're naked and grappling at his shirt, jet pack, and face. morty is screaming. 
morty: rick! help! stop touching me! gross! the flood of falling sand people are heading towards the inner city, right towards summer. rick swoops down and grabs her hand just before she is enveloped by the sea of people. watch out! 
summer: as he pulls back up, an angry rioter jumps onto rick's back, tearing off one of the jets. he's all lopsided now. summer is holding on tight, sliding across the ground. 
rick: woah, we're in a bit of a sandy situation! haha, am i right? what?? summer 
rick: like a sticky situat-whatever, just hang on. the sand people now have morty tied to a wooden cross and are carrying him off like some kind of holy son. 
rick: nice, morty, way to go on this one. did a real bang up job, didn't ya? rick and summer struggle to get to morty. suddenly we hear a mass screaming and the sound of rushing water. the sand people in the area stop and look towards the screaming. a giant tsunami wave is crashing over the land. the people drop morty and begin to run for their lives. 
sand person: it's the end of times! big morty has smited us! rick uses this opportunity to help morty get untied. 
rick: jesus, morty, tied to a cross? you really are full of yourself aren't you? 
summer and morty: just get us out of here, rick! they all run towards the ship. the tsunami wave is approaching fast. 
rick: morty! morty, i just thought of an even better way to create a utopian society! 
morty: fuck it, rick! screw those guys, get us out of here! they barely make it to the ship in time to take off. sand bodies float all around as they lift off out of the water and fly away. 
[int. bar - day] 
beth: no answer.. 
jerry: you sneak out the back, beth. i'm turning myself in. 
beth: jerry no, we can find a way, we just have to wait- 
jerry: the kids need you beth. beth is touched. 
beth: but i need you, jerry. she grabs jerry's hand and gives an assuring nod. they embrace once more. jerry yells out the window. 
jerry: we're gonna surrender! don't shoot! please! they step out together into the police spot light. heavily armed officers and police vehicles all around... they open fire!!! hundreds of bullets impact their bodies as beth and jerry scream. it goes completely dark. we hear rick in the background, the color is normal again. 
rick: excuse me, pardon me. he pushes his way through the officers as they stand frozen. beth and jerry look up, tears in their eyes. wha-what? dad?! jerry 
beth: jerry checks his body for bullet holes. he has a pee stain on his pants. 
rick: hahaha, nice one, jerry! you really peed your pants! 
beth: what's going on? 
rick: you tell me! i leave you two alone in an augmented reality for less than a day and you're already wanted criminals. beth and jerry look at each other. defeated, they walk back to rick's ship and head home.

summer and morty sit on the couch watching space billy mays do his thing, vacuuming the floor. they hear rick enter with beth and jerry from the garage. they rush billy mays out the front door. 
summer: hey mom, did you guys have a good time? was it the excitement you were looking for? 
beth: cut the cord summer. 
morty: (to rick) well i guess, i guess we both lost the bet, huh? we really messed up that one. 
rick: yeah, i guess so. 
morty: so can you really create a utopia just by dressing people up like bees and giving them honey, rick? bees? jerry 
rick: haha, you sure can morty.. with mind control honey! 
morty: mind control?! 
jerry: i crave their organization, and i envy the utopian society that they have. i think it's impressive. they have a perfectly functioning society. some of their science is fantastic. the development of the hexagon, the world's strongest geometric shape. it's used in carbon fiber, race cars and spacecraft. nobody can improve on it. everybody looks at jerry. 
rick: you said it, jerry. rick kicks his feet up onto the coffee table and they all share a big family laugh. 
[int. laundromat - day] 
cosmic billy mays: cosmic billy mays here! how many of you--billy is standing over a white, stained, pair of pants. he pukes a little bit on his shirt and dabs it with a cloth. the stain vanishes almost instantly. 
cosmic billy mays: how many of you consider yourselves real neat freaks, super germaphobes? i know i am! he grabs a bottle of bleach from under the table and twists off the cap. 
cosmic billy mays: what if i told you the solution is in this bottle right here, and the it's as easy as one!.. two!.. three! he begins to pour the bleach onto his eyeballs. his eyeballs start to melt. 
cosmic billy mays: and i know what you're thinking now! you're thinking"well wait a minute billy, what about the obnoxious odors?!"he takes his nose and rips it off. 
cosmic billy mays: how do people smell if they don't have noses?!

a portal appears above the sea, the tops of skyscrapers mark where civilization once lived. rick and morty drop into the ocean. 
rick: what the fuck? morty holds a camera above his head, and water drips from it. 
morty: rick get us out of here! 
rick: no shit morty, this place is fucked. rick creates a new portal. 
[ext. earth, scorched - night] 
the portal appears on earth, this time the planet’s on fire. lava runs down the sides of mountains. smoke bellows from the burnt soil. water pours out of the portal. it cools the lava, and turns it into solid rock. rick and morty land on the rock. 
rick: not having much luck today. morty takes a photo. 
morty: that s like the tenth planet in a row. 
rick: sorry morty, i know you wanted to see a cool new planet earth. let s go home. 
morty: you know rick, that last planet was full of water; no water here. if you create a portal and empty half the planet s water supply to this planet, and grabbed all those prehistoric animals from the third place we visited, we could save two planets. 
rick: you re right, we could save this planet and fix the mess god left behind. 
morty: it ll be like earth two point 0. why didn t you think of that? 
rick: (startled) ah, em, i did, just didn t care to mention, you know, sometimes your grandpa likes to be humble and not shove my intelligence in your face.

morty: i was going to say just like a superhero, but god works. jerry2 stares at rick s shelves, pokes his hands in boxes, and picks up gadgets. 
(a sign hangs from the shelves "don t touch, danger i.q. 140 only") 
rick: em jerry, what the fuck are you doing? a startled jerry turns around. 
jerry2: oh you re here, didn t see you there. rick clicks his fingers at jerry2 as if he s a dog. walks over grabs the gadget from jerry2 s hand, and then sets it back on the shelf. 
rick: jerry focus! why are you risking your life looking through my work? i told you my stuff is booby-trapped. 
jerry2: you did, when? rick opens the door. 
rick: get out, that s enough q a for today. jerry2 walks out.

jerry2: hm, small world. rick just kicked me out of his lab for going through his stuff.

jerry3: hi rick. 
rick: bye idiot. rick slams the door shut. 
morty: that was weird. 
rick: what was? your father always gets trapped in there. 
morty: yes, that s true, but that s another jerry. a sudden realization comes over rick. 
rick: dammit, morty, i was in holiday mode. rick grabs his flask, and takes a drink. rick back to normal. drinks again. flips his whiteboard. a scoreboard marks the top right corner rick 4 revenge rick- (ez4) 2 rick strikes out the 2, replaces it with a 4. the rest of the whiteboard details various plans, building plans, planets, and a crude drawing of the spacecar with a line drawn from it with the wordstake microverse battery 
rick: two jerrys isn t just a coincidence, it s revenge rick. that bastard is at it again. rick writes on the board. 
rick: i ve managed to shield you from revenge morty until now. revenge? 
morty: what did you do rick? 
rick: what did he do morty? that guy s got an attitude problem. 
morty: he has an attitude problem? rick looks at morty. 
rick: don t test me morty. this guy is pissing me off. morty so what are you going to do? rick points to the whiteboardproject blue beam

god hologram: i will surge into your minds, i m your antichrist, your god, your worst nightmare if you dare not believe. the twelve jerrys panic and run home. the garage door opens.

trainer: (to assistant) that was the ten losing race. time to put this one out to pasture. assistant not another one. i hate my job. that s the third horse this month. beth gasps. he walks over to a cabinet markedguns 
trainer: that s what you re paid to do. get on with it. now the assistant takes out a shotgun. 
assistant: (reluctant) okay. the trainer exits. the assistant points the shotgun at the horse. 
assistant: sorry buddy, it s no hard feelings you know. beth taps him on the shoulder. he looks over his shoulder.

[int. earth ez4, revenge rick’s garage - day] 
the place has been turned into an old fashion classroom. all twelve jerrys sit behind all on one table. revenge rick has drawn rick on his blackboard with enemy above his head. 
revenge rick: listen up. in order to defeat my enemy, i must get to know my enemy. if you were to get revenge on your rick, what would you do? 
jerry5: (hesitant) you want to listen to us? 
revenge rick: want s a strong word. dumbness has its own defying logic no genius can understand. 
jerry8: i don t get it. 
revenge rick: it s the butterfly effect or in my world, chaos theory every single fucking day. the snowball effect of one small change can have a large impact elsewhere. like when you married my daughter. so no matter what your best efforts are, i ll break it down, see the unintended consequences, and use that angle against rick. the unintended consequence is that logic or thought the human race can never foresee, until now. so your dumb shit isn t what i want, it s the afters i m after. got it? 
jerry8: no. 
rick: as expected. going to plan. away. fire away. (jerry9 raises his arm.) 
jerry9: hi, i m jerry. 
revenge rick: fuck no, next! another jerry5 raises his arm. 
jerry5: i ve always wanted to stupidly slip on water and fall into you. that way it s not my fault. 
revenge rick: (shakes head) typical pathetic jerry move. the other jerrys angrily give jerry5 the evil eye, a paper ball hits him, and another pushes him from behind. 
jerry4: don t tell him that! that s our secret! you should know better. 
revenge rick: wait what the, you re not my jerry? all you dummies look alike. 
jerry5: i take that back. up. just made that jerry5 laughs it off then looks down. 
revenge rick: this plan will never work, i m too smart for this dumb shit. i should have known better than to listen to you fuckwits. revenge rick s morty2 walks in. 
morty2: rick, summer won t leave me alone. morty pauses, looks at all the jerrys. 
morty2: (slowly) hi dads. revenge rick looks at his board. 
morty2: rick, what are you doing? 
revenge rick: i m working on my master plan for revenge on evil rick. got any ideas. 
morty2: hmmm, i normally ask you. revenge rick clicks his fingers as he points to the sky. 
revenge rick: that s it, me! glad i thought of it. 
morty2: (puzzled) what, you? 
revenge rick: evil rick must have the exact same methodology, just with weaker ideas, although better than your dumb dad s ideas. i ll use his idea, improve it. i mean my idea on him. 
morty2: i m confused. 
revenge rick: it s okay morty, you ll catch up on the way. revenge rick takes out his portal gun, then creates a portal.

morty2: what the fuck rick, mom s stealing horses. 
revenge rick: she s not your mom, she s a horse medic. it s probably her pet.

beth: back so soon? what happened? 
revenge rick: i changed my mind. beth, what s up with mr ed in the garden? 
beth: i m looking after him, you know i m a horse doctor. 
revenge rick: horses belong in a stable, not kept like pets hidden from view. 
beth: aren t you mr opinionated all of a sudden. 
revenge rick: i really don t care; just wondered. 
beth: do you now want dessert? revenge rick looks at an apple pie center of the table. 
revenge rick: thanks sweetie, give my slice to morty. 
beth: but he s had two slices already. 
revenge rick: he loves your dessert so much. it s a slice of happiness i want to give morty.

beth: okay, dad. 
summer: mom, who does the horse belong to? 
beth: currently, it s me. 
summer: it belongs to someone, that fact i know is true. and they ll be looking for him. 
beth: he s got a disease, i can t let it infect the other horses. 
summer: (uneasy) shit, is it dangerous? 
beth: it s a horse not human, you ll be fine. 
summer: what s his name?

summer: oh god, i bet worth a million bucks. you re in deep trouble. 
beth: again, horse doctor. 
summer: that old chestnut. so you ll give him back once he s better huh? 
beth: maybe, if he recovers. summer walks over to the window. 
summer: he looks fine. 
beth: he s not. 
summer: if you say so.

morty2: how so? 
revenge rick: look at this place, evil rick has it in for me. revenge rick scans the room. he reads out c137 rick s ideas. 
revenge rick: implant jerry s soul, steal microverse, trap me in ice comet, frame me for jfk. this rick s so lame. can t this fucking guy think of an original idea? morty2 picks up a gadget. revenge rick forgets himself. 
revenge rick: morty put that down before you. revenge rick takes the gadget out of morty2 s hand. 
revenge rick: that s it. revenge rick grabs a tool, takes off the cover. 
morty2: what is it? 
revenge rick: i m going to break all these lame gadgets. they ll all blow up in his stupid face. 
morty2: he could be doing the same to you right now. 
revenge rick: you forget yourself morty. i ve just thought of it. evil rick won t think of this idea before it s too late. and besides, he already thinks he has the upper hand. he has no reason to enact revenge.

rick throws the slice of cake into the bin next to the door. rick suddenly sees twelve jerrys stare back at him from their seats. 
rick: (surprised) whoa. why are you dummies here? i know i wouldn t be so altruistic to help make you smarter, can t teach an idiot when the brain gave up at birth. 
morty: what s going on? 
jerry3: the other rick wanted us to help him defeat you. a jerry4 who sits behind jerry3 pushes his shoulder. 
jerry4: shush, don t say that. 
rick: say what? 
jerry3: rick, you, the other rick told us not to tell you rick, what he was planning. 
jerry4: idiot. 
jerry9: moron. rick turns to morty. 
rick: the other rick is failing in life if he s asking a jerry for help. 
morty: he s desperate. 
rick: (to jerry3) so why is the other rick not here? 
jerry3: he thought the best person to listen to was himself. 
rick: the council of ricks? 
jerry3: no, you. 
rick: the smartest scientist in the universe! wabba labba dub dub. 
morty: but we re here. and he hates you. how the... 
rick: relax morty, he s gone to my lab to steal. smart man. if you can t beat him, steal and usurp me. he knows who s boss. he s a dead man. rick walks over to a storage cabinet, opens the door, slides out a large rock with a broken mirror attached, then picks up a control. 
rick: (rhetorical) what s this bozo up to? a circular dial and digital numeric display atop. he turns the dial. planet earth on fire appears in the mirror. turns the dial again, sees another jerry13 poking through his belongs in the mirror. rick picks up the empty plate, throws it at jerry 
rick: you nosy bastard. stay out! turns the dial again. summer stares at the time travel stuff box. 
rick: (warning) summer. turns the dial again. rick sees revenge rick under the hood of his spacecar, breaking a wire to the microverse battery, then affixes an object to it. 
rick: (under his breath) a ha. caught you red-handed you bastard. 
revenge rick  (o. s.) : evil rick, you fucking rude bastard, i got you; got you good. (evil laugh) 
morty: you both sound the same. 
rick: i don t speak like that handsome bastard.

rick: two can play at this game. won t see this coming. he beth walks in.

jerry11: it s in advertising dummy. jerry8 obviously advertising, what other job can we do? morty waves his arms. 
morty: quiet! the only way to solve this is to play a quick game of guess who? rick continues dismantling the spacecar. 
rick: genius morty. 
beth2: all of you put your hands up. now when i ask a question, if you aren t my jerry, put your hand down. who here kept talking about that stupid advert got milk? all jerrys keep their arms up. 
beth2: hmmm. keep your hands up if you took me out to a funfair on our first date. no jerry lets their arms come down. rick turns to the class. 
rick: (impatient) who here wet themselves when the car backfired last week? six jerrys lower their arms. 
beth2: thanks, dad. 
rick: you re welcome, sweetie. 
beth2: keep your arm raised if you were interviewed by the company called simplyscripts. com. four jerrys lower their arms. 
beth2: who did i punch this morning for farting in bed? a jerry lowers his arm. beth2 walks over to her jerry9, and hugs him. 
beth2: congratulations. 
jerry9: there is a god! i will never fart on you again. i love you. 
beth2: (smiles) you better not. i love you too. rick slams the spacecar s hood down. 
rick: god this lovefest is making me sick. rick opens a cabinet marked supplies, and sees an open bag of glowing red rocks sits center. he grabs the bag. moves his arm across all shelves, pushing all the various supplies into the bag. 
rick: come on morty, let s go. rick creates a portal, morty and rick leave. 
[ext. earth c137, smith residence, garden - evening] 
rick and morty arrive. they hide behind a bush, peer through the kitchen window, and see beth and summer sit at the table. summer uses her hand to cover her nose and mouth. 
rick: (whispers) shush morty, we need those two idiots to leave. 
morty: (whispers) i didn t say anything. rick rolls his eyes. 
rick: (whispers) the very thing i tried to stop. the horse walks over to morty, and blows its nostrils over him. mucus slime covers morty like silly string. 
morty: ah gross. wish mom got rid of this stupid horse. he takes off his shirt, then wipes his head and arms down. 
rick: it s just a phase she s going through morty, she ll get over it. 
morty: she better or i m going to the racecourse tomorrow. 
rick: not cool morty, no one likes a snitch. i d expect this behavior from jerry but not from you. 
morty: easy coming from someone not covered in snot. 
rick: shush. 
[int. earth c137, smith residence, kitchen - evening] 
ez4 revenge rick and morty2 walk in. revenge rick walks over to the fridge, grabs a beer. 
revenge rick: so thirsty. morty covers his nose and mouth. 
[ext. earth c137, smith residence, garden - evening] 
rick: that s my beer! bastard! morty puts his finger to his mouth. 
morty: (whispers) shush. rick squints his eyes at morty. 
rick: (whispers) bastard! 
[int. earth c137, smith residence, kitchen - evening] 
ez4 revenge rick creates a portal, then covers his nose and mouth. 
revenge rick: woah beth, this place, it s like a manure farm. where the only high priced organic produce is shit. we re offski before i blow my brains out for tranquility. 
beth: going off on another adventure? don t be long, morty has school tomorrow. 
revenge rick: school is for losers. 
morty2: bye, mom. ez4 revenge rick and morty2 leave. c137 rick and morty re-enter the kitchen by the door. 
morty: hi mom. beth drops food from her mouth. hi, again. 
beth: changed your mind dad? 
rick: remind me sweetie. 
beth: i said don t be long. 
rick: and. 
beth: morty has school. 
rick: school is for losers. 
beth: well, what matters is that you re both home. 
rick: why does this place smell like a shithole? beth looks outside. 
beth: isn t that nice, a full moon. do you think dad? what 
rick: i ll ignore that deflection, you re bringing the horse in here while we re not around, aren t you? rick looks down, and sees horseshoe marks across the kitchen floor. 
beth: is it that obvious? 
summer: mom, even a hobo would move out. rick pinches his nose. 
rick: like a hobo, i m out of here too. morty, stay here, your grandpa s got to fix the mess he left behind. morty sits at the table, pinches his nose, then takes a drink. 
morty: aw, do i have to? rick exits. 
[int. earth c137, smith residence, garage - evening] 
rick enters. he picks up the first gadget he sees, looks at it. 
rick: sloppy, just bad evil rick. obvious. so he pulls out a device, then re-attaches some wiring. 
rick: to think i d fall for that. you must be kidding. 
[int. earth c137, smith residence, kitchen - evening] 
the doorbell goes. morty stands up. 
morty: i ll get it. 
beth: thanks morty. morty exits. 
[int. earth c137, smith residence, living room - evening] 
morty answers the door. a jockey takes his hat off. 
morty: hello, what do you want? 
jockey: is lord flashheart here? who? 
morty: try the neighbors. morty tries to close the door. a foot stops it closing. 
jockey: it s not a person, it s my horse. 
morty: oh so you re not in fancy dress. you really go about your business wearing that silly outfit, do you? 
jockey: i ve just finished an evening race. i will change when i get home. there was a mistake at the racecourse. they were going to kill him, but your mom inadvertently saved him. i want to give him away as a present to my daughter. i know he s here. your mom has a history. i want him back. morty arches his head back. 
morty: (shouts) mom, it s for you, sort your shit out. i m going to sleep. morty leaves just as beth comes to the door. 
beth: hmmm, it s you. 
jockey: who would you expect at this time? of course, it s me. where is he, where s lord flashheart? 
beth: i m a horse doctor, i m looking after him. 
jockey: he s not yours, let me in. beth stands back and opens the door wider. fine. 
beth: go get him. jockey storms past her. a moment later, leads the horse through the door. 
jockey: don t come back to the racecourse, you re blacklisted. she crosses her arms. 
beth: you can t stop me saving lives! you hear me!? she closes the front door. 
[int. earth ez4, revenge rick's garage - day] 
revenge rick: hm, i m all out of osei nana navitas rocks. 
morty2: what s the plan for today? 
revenge rick: rectal five, a planet off the secrum region, got to fill up. revenge rick gets into his spacecar. 
[int. earth ez4, revenge rick’s spacecar - day] 
he presses the ’on’ button. the spacecar explodes; which creates a massive crater.the end. 
[int. smith residence, kitchen - morning] 
rick and morty enter. jerry, beth, and summer sit eating their breakfast. 
morty: when you put mentos into diet coke, why does it explode? 
rick: i said test me, not throw trivia at me. this is so fucking simple, it s a waste of my time. 
morty: you could have told me by now. don t you feel like you ve wasted your time moaning? 
rick: it s never a waste. i ve made my point. it s caused by a physical reaction that affects the growth rate of carbon dioxide bubbles, encouraged by the disruption of polar attractions between water molecules creating bubble growth sites. simply put, the rougher the surface, the more bubbles, the higher the geyser. rick and morty sit down. 
beth: that s enough science at the table. you know how much it hurts jerry s head. 
rick: i don t usually talk shop knowing the level i m working with. it slipped out. it s all morty s fault. jerry s eyes look up to the corner of the room. he then nods. 
jerry: no it s okay. i know what they re talking about. it s down to the nucleation process. i m not a dummy. (to beth) is there any coffee? summer drops her knife. morty freezes and drops his jaw. rick screws his face, and catches jerry s eyes looking up past rick s shoulder. then rick looks over his shoulder and sees nothing. he picks up his spoon and begins to eat. 
rick: that silence you re hearing jerry is your family s stunned reaction. 
jerry: stop stirring rick. they re not silent. you re being over-dramatic again. 
summer: no grandpa s right. we re shocked. 
jerry: no you re not summer. stop playing along. 
rick: in this family there s an intelligence pecking order. summer and beth are above you and morty isn t that far behind you. i m obviously the smartest here. that s a no-brainer. but when you understand anything scientific i say before summer does, then something s definitely wrong. 
beth: (to jerry) are you okay? did you hit your head? beth reaches over and touches jerry s head. the doorbell rings. jerry pushes beth s arm away, then stands up. he walks to the front door. 
jerry: you re all paranoid. door. i ll get the 
[int. smith residence, living room - morning] 
jerry opens the front door. the postman holds a digital signature pad. 
postman: you got to sign for this. jerry takes the pad and signs it. 
jerry: okay. i wonder what this is. the postman hands over an envelope. 
postman: it seems important my man! jerry closes the door. he opens the envelope, then takes out the letter. in large font it states congratulations, you ve got the job 
jerry: congratulations, you ve got the job. please start this monday nine o clock. jerry smiles and tears the letter into quarters. then he throws it into a bin next to the entrance. 
[int. smith residence, kitchen - morning] 
rick walks over to the kitchen counter. 
rick: morty come over here. i want to show you something. morty follows. 
morty: what is it rick? rick grabs a bottle of diet coke, a packet of mentos, a pin, and some string. 
rick: you want to know what the best thing about science is? 
morty: is it the awards, medals or recognition from your peers? 
rick: fuck no, that s easy. nobel can shove his award he knows where. it s the pranks. 
morty: cool! rick opens the bottle, places the lid next to it, then grabs the pin and string. 
rick: you take this pin, attach the string, feed it through the center of the mento, and loop it back to tie a knot. he holds the string up and shows the mento hanging. then grabs the bottle lid. 
rick: you place the mento inside the bottle at the top, slowly screw the lid on gently, then pull the string so the mento is hidden from view. then lastly cut the end of the string. we don t want jerry to suspect someone s tampered with his diet coke. 
morty: maybe after this, he ll go on a proper diet and not drink it. 
rick: you re right morty. diet drinks are the biggest con in the industry. replace one sugar with a substitute. both equally as bad as each other. take it from a scientist. i know. beth walks over to the sink and drops off some dirty dishes. 
beth: what are you two rascals doing? you know how much he doesn t like anyone touching his things. get out of the kitchen before he notices. 
rick: we were just leaving. see here. nothing to rick leaves for the garage. 
morty: (laughs) yeah nothing to see. morty enters the living room. 
[int. smith residence, garage - morning] 
rick enters and walks over to a miniature house replicating the smith home that doesn’t have a front wall. a dashboard displays various buttons equaling separate time periods. the buttons denote, last hour, six hours, twelve hours, twenty-four hours, fast forward, rewind, remove entity, and undo. rick presses the button for twenty-four hours. the smith family appear as holograms around the home. h.morty’s in his room, h.summer’s in hers, h.beth’s in the bathroom, and h.jerry’s downstairs watching television. h.rick views the entire smith household’s activities from the night before in the garage. morty enters. 
morty: what are you doing rick? 
rick: did you see the look on jerry s face? no, why? though. 
morty: dad sounds different 
rick: he sure does. that bastards up to something. morty sees the miniature house. 
morty: are you playing with a dollhouse? 
rick: take a closer look einstein. 
morty: is that us? 
rick: yeah. i can t believe this, but i think i missed something. morty it hasn t gone unnoticed, try not to masturbate when i m experimenting. gives me the shudders. 
morty: (shocked) how was i suppose to know you re peeping on us? when was this? 
rick: last night. aw jeez, you re about to do it again. look away morty. h. morty sits on the bed and brings up the site rubhub. tv. h. rick averts his eyes and shudders. rick averts his eyes and shudders too. 
h. rick: not again morty. morty uses his hands to block rick s view of h. morty. 
morty: (gulps, impatient) last night? can you quickly skip past ten o clock rick! 
rick: can t morty. i ll just remove you. rick selects h. morty and presses to remove entity. a relieved morty removes his hands. 
morty: that was close. a few moments later, h. jerry stands up, stares into the television. 
h. jerry: what s going on? the television flickers, scrambles, then strange sounds emit. a bright light flashes that blinds everyone s view. h. jerry s eyes look straightforward and don t blink. he walks away and leaves the television on. 
rick: there! he s been manipulated somehow through the television. it s like subliminal advertising using sex to sell. if you blink you miss it. one frame of animation displaying the word sex across the entire screen. oh wow. smart. 
morty: i thought he suddenly got 
rick: (laughs) never ever going to happen. rick walks to the door. 
rick: back in a minute. 8. 
[int. smith residence, living room - morning] 
rick approaches jerry who’s looking out the window. 
jerry: have you come to apologize for your behavior rick? 
rick: fuck no. rick quickly brings out his stun gun and shoots jerry. jerry falls, his head smacks off the wall, then floor, and creates a huge thud. rick then carries jerry over his shoulder. 
beth  (o. s.) : is that you dad? 
rick: that was jerry s head against the floor, so inconsiderate. 
beth: okay dad. 
[int. smith residence, garage - morning] 
jerry’s on an examination table. light overhead and various devices along with hospital equipment, are placed next to jerry’s unconscious body. 
morty: what are you going to do? rick presses a button. a laser scans jerry s head and body. a display highlights the results. 
rick: jerry s a clone. 
morty: my dad s not real? jerry reads the instruments findings. 
rick: what a mess. missing organs, smarter intelligence. this clone s a fucking disgrace. you could have done better. 
morty: (puzzled) emmm, okay. rick extracts dna, puts it through the dna sequencer. 
rick: what the fuck. the house of taigs. 
morty: are these aliens bad? 
rick: really bad. they re more famously recognized as the cult of fenians. they re pissed at me because a deal we agreed on, didn t work out as expected. 
morty: what did you do rick? 
rick: don t go to the worst possible thought morty. it s not always my fault. 
morty: it usually is. what happened back then? rick walks over to a cabinet, and takes out a vial with a glowing blue particle. 
rick: better. they had asked me to create a new element for them. i call it element rick. it was so powerful, eternal energy, the best element ever, and most powerful known to man. you could consume it, turn you into a superhero, create structures, weapons, everything. so versatile just like me. i couldn t let them have it, it would destroy their economy. i had to keep it to save them. you d say i was altruistic if you knew the word. 
morty: (rhetorical) i would? 
rick: (pleased) thanks morty. i knew you d understand. rick gives morty goggles, then holds his own goggles, and then gives jerry an electric shock. jerry speaks, even though he s still unconscious. 
jerry: (mumbles) tiocfaidh ar la. 
rick: definitely different. when stunned, jerry normally just twitches and pisses himself. 
morty: what s he saying? gibberish. sounds like 
rick: it s taigish; an alien language. jerry s been captured. it s up to us to save him. 
morty: again. 
rick: it s tiring i know. but your mother would want it this way. 
[int. smith residence, living room - morning] 
summer looks in the bin, picks up ripped letter, and holds the pieces together. 
summer: congratulations, you start monday. what s going on? 
[int. smith residence, garage - morning] 
summer enters. 
summer: dad ripped up his first job acceptance letter. his dream job. summer sees jerry on the table; with rick and morty next to him. 
summer: (gasps) what the fuck are you doing grandpa? rick, startled, drops the electric prodding device on jerry, and electrocutes him again. 
rick: oops. summer don t just walk in unannounced. now look what you made me do. jerry bursts into flames. summer screams. 
rick: relax summer, he s an empty vessel. 
summer: i know that! 
morty: he s a clone summer. it s not dad. he s been kidnapped. we ve been infiltrated. morty walks over to the spacecar, opens the door. 
morty: let s do this. can we be back for lunch? 
rick: thirty minutes tops. these aliens are sneaky, but not smart. rick grabs a pyramid shaped gadget with a light on top, and puts it into a bag. then slings it over his shoulder. 
summer: hey, can i come? 
rick: no whining, bitching, moaning. no summer being summer. then you can come. i need someone to look after the car. 
summer: i might as well play dead. 
rick: (ponders) hmmm, that s an improvement. 
[int. smith residence, living room - morning] 
beth sits opposite the television. she looks around. 
beth: summer, morty, jerry, dad? she changes the channel. a school building appears on the television. 
announcer  (v. o.) : this is a public announcement for the abolition of humans. 
beth: strange. 
[ext. school - day] 
shotgun jim 40, takes his children pistol pete 6 and machinegun mandy 5 to school. 
shotgun jim: stay safe. what do you do when you see a human? 
pistol pete: you run and hide. 
announcer  (v. o.) : we are tired of our children being killed at our schools. smith wesson bill approaches shotgun jim. 
smith   wesson bill: we don t like your kind round here. 
shotgun jim: i don t want any trouble. please, not in front of the children. smith wesson bill takes out a human from his holster, draws it, then aims. 
smith   wesson bill: you re going to wish you never came here. 
human: you re all going to die motherfucker. 
shotgun jim: please put your dangerous evil weapon away! there s children here. smith wesson bill shoots the human at pistol pete and machinegun mandy. the human screams as he flies through the air, and impales into pistol pete. 
human: (screams) ahhh! 
machinegun mandy: (cries) oh no pete, dad! 
shotgun jim: (panic s) no! the human has killed pistol pete. 
announcer  (v. o.) : ban humans now. all human weapons of destruction that bring misery upon all our lives. ban all weapons of war. never react alone.

beth’s eyes are wide open. 
beth: that s messed up. 
[int. spacecar - day] 
summer’s on her phone. 
morty: (stresses normally) rick, what did you mean when you stunned dad by the words, normally just twitches? 
rick: i love the enthusiasm morty. but there s a time and place to ask questions. now s not the time. 
morty: when is the time? morty looks out the window. stars steak pass. 
morty: i m bored, the radio doesn t work. your music, i don t think has a name. what are you hiding rick? 
summer: yeah grandpa, what are you hiding? 
rick: geesus, fucking kids. look, sometimes your grandpa has to make sure. 
summer: go on. 
rick: i ve been conducting tests on you all every week since i moved in. what?! 
morty: why would you do that? 
rick: relax morty, it s a good thing. you all should be thanking me! i make sure you re well, in good heath, and not alien. 
summer: what about dad? it didn t work then. 
rick: oh god summer. such a pain in my ass. the clone slipped in last night. what s wrong with you morty? what?! 
morty: i didn t say anything. 
rick: that s my point. you let your sister throw her accusations without defending me. 
morty: you can defend yourself. asking questions. i m tired 
rick: thank god. 
summer: what do you think they re doing to dad? 
rick: probably probing him. a man made false positive walking contradiction. 
summer: what if... 
rick: (interrupts summer) we re here, no more questions! rick parks the spacecar at what looks like a circular amusement space station. 
rick: don t believe what you see or think. if you want something, you really don t. got it?! 
morty: (dismissive) we can look after ourselves. 
summer: sure grandpa. rick shakes his head. he opens the door, grabs the bag with the device. 
rick: morty come. summer stay put. 
summer: awww.

beth: dad? she sees the miniature smith home and walks over to inspect. presses the button for last hour. the holograms of the family reappear. h. rick and h. morty are next to h. jerry who lies on the table tied up. 
beth: oh no, what are you all doing? 
[h. summer enters.] 
summer: dad ripped up his first job acceptance letter. his dream job.

rick: oops. summer, don t just walk in unannounced. now look what you made me do. h. jerry bursts into flames. h. summer screams. a shocked beth turns off the holograms. 
beth: oh my god jerry. what have they done to you? she starts to cry. she picks it up. her eyes notice the ripped up letter. 
beth: huh. he really did rip up the letter. so unlike him. (ponders) unless... 
[int. rocco rankshank’s amusement spacestation - evening] 
rick and morty walk in, stop, then look around. two alien strippers approach rick and morty. they take an arm each. 
alien stripper: (to morty) let me show you around the place. (whispers in his ear) and maybe we can have some fun, if you know what i mean. 
morty: em, i think i do. okay. 
rick: (to his alien stripper) not today. rick s on business. (to morty s alien stripper) inappropriate, lady! come back in four years. rick pulls his arm away from his alien stripper, then grabs morty s arm. rick keep walking morty. if you stand still something will jump on you. worse than a homeless person trying to clean a car windscreen in rush hour. arcades with holograms try to entice new customers. slot machines advertise a million billion danks currency. a sign catches morty s eyefree computer games this way 
morty: free games, hell yeah. i hope my gpu can handle them though. 
rick: can t believe i m going to say this. morty stay on topic, we re here to save jerry. rick shakes his head. 
rick: some days i hate myself. alien waitresses that appear like ladybugs, walk about with their trays and drinks. barmen aliens are like octopuses. 
rick: hmmm no security, guards, police, soldiers, or undercover spies. 
morty: how do you know no one is undercover? 
rick: why would they have spies within their own premises? they d be glorified guards. look around morty. do you see a suit? anybody carrying a weapon? 
morty: i guess not. you got me there. 
rick: come on. rick and morty walk towards the center. gas clouds descends in front of them. 
rick: watch out taigs, ch4 inorganic chemicals, butt gas morty. cover your nose. these dingbats are those aliens i told you about. morty blocks his nostrils. 
morty: oh god the smell. it s in my mouth. the ch4 gas clouds form loose blobs, and then faces form. 
taig leader: rick you dick! where s my element? you untrustworthy bastard. 
rick: that s no way to greet an old friend. be thankful you re still alive taig, and you re welcome. 
taig leader: i m using language you ll understand. rick sets the bag down, opens it, then turns on the device. light emits from it, blinking initially slowly in a circular motion, as it starts to speed up. 
rick: i m fed up with your kind taking advantage of the disadvantaged. 
taig leader: what are you doing? snokey rokey, an alien entertainer dressed as a belly dancer, approaches morty. a slithery snake-like alien with hypnoctic eyes offers a dance. 
snokey rokey: want a dance? morty looks into her eyes and smiles. 
morty: (mesmerized) okay. he takes a seat. 
rick: no morty, look away! 
morty: this is better than rubhub. 
rick: i feel a shudder coming on. taig leader points to the various taig soldiers to take action. 
taig leader: get him! the device reaches it s climax. a bright light flashes blinding everyone. the taig aliens solidify and fall to the ground with tiny pieces that break off. a quick sound emits afterwards, then slowly comes to a halt. then smoke comes out of it. rick kicks it, and then brings out his gun. 
rick: damn intergalactic internet, and cheap knock off goods from the planet ohina. the warranty just expired too. the taig aliens can t move. 
taig leader: you won t get away with this you dick. rick shoots the alien taig soldiers. 
rick: but i have you fops. rick shoots taig leader. 
morty: that was easy. 
rick: i need a drink. rick waves over a ladybug waitress. 
ladtbug waitress: (old raspy voice) what be having you? 
rick: a bottle of your strongest liqueur. none of that pussy watered down shit you import from trumpistan. 
ladybug waitress: one zakar coming up. 
morty: where s dad? 
rick: probably knee deep in the mindfuck shit he s always dreamt of. 
morty: ah, so nearby eh? rick rolls his eyes. 
rick: this way. they turn a corner and see jerry relaxing on a sun lounger. he s surrounded by hazy substance that s fixed in place, glows, and wobbles in the middle of a large arena. 
morty: dad? 
rick: he can t hear you morty. dream-like mindset. he s in a 
morty: so he s drugged. 
rick: basically. pull your top over your mouth and nose. they enter the haze. 
[ext. island beach - day] 
they step into jerry’s hallucination that the haze has revealed. they stand behind everyone. j.beth and j.summer throw a frisbee to each other. j.morty plays in the sand. j.rick stands next to jerry, whilst he holds a tray of drinks. sleepy gary relaxes on his lounger. he reaches out his cocktail, and touches jerry’s cocktail as they meet in the middle. they both lie under a large sun umbrella. a cabinet full of trophies, certificates, and meddles sit in the sand in front of jerry. 
sleepy gary: this is the best jerry. thank you so much for bringing me to this wonderful place. you re amazing. (to the family) isn't this man wonderful?! 
j. beth: the best. 
j. summer: i ve got the most amazing dad ever. 
j. morty: i just want to be like you when i grow up. 
jerry: thank you sleepy gary. thank you all for your kind words. 
morty: (whispers to rick) why s sleepy gary here? 
rick: morty, ignore jerry s gay thoughts. it s not always what it seems. 
morty: i think i m going to be sick. 
rick: me too. don t tell your mom. it would devastate her. jerry consumes his drink quickly, then holds up his empty glass. 
jerry: (to j. rick) rick, i need another. sleepy gary shakes his glass. rattles. the cocktail umbrella 
sleepy gary: don t forget me jerry. 
jerry: i won t sleepy gary. rick creeps up behind j. rick, and then pulls him back. 
jerry: (annoyed) rick, i m waiting! 
rick: fuck off jerry. if you want a drink, ask your boyfriend. 
sleepy gary: that s no way to talk to the man of the year. jerry looks up. 
jerry: (shocked) what did you just say? that s no way to talk to your savior. 
rick: (slowly) fuck right off jerry. your dream s worse than a concentration camp. the ladybug waitress arrives with rick s drink. he grabs it. 
rick: perfect timing. jerry stands up and looks around. 
jerry: huh, what s going on. this is supposed to be an exclusive beach. 
rick: look around jerry. two ricks, two mortys. sleepy gary was two seasons ago. you ve taken the mandela effect to a whole new level. 
morty: we re here to save you dad. lets go already. 
jerry: i don t need saving son. i m in paradise. 
rick: you re in hell and you don t even know it. rick punches jerry and knocks him out. all apparitions disappear. rick grabs jerry s arms. 
rick: grab the legs morty.

summer sits in the spacecar. she puts her phone away.

beth: he s gone. your father s gone forever. rick and morty swing jerry, and drop him on the floor next to the coffee table. 
rick: no he s not. geesus beth. you really need to get a grip. the crash landing awakens jerry. jerry sits up, then rubs his head. 
jerry: ouch. 
beth: eh, i thought you all killed him. 
jerry: hi beth. i m so happy to see you. rick grabs a handful of ash. 
rick: if i killed him, there would be no evidence. i m not a hack. jerry picks up some ash, then looks at the photo. 
jerry: lovely. i m back and it s as if i m not even here. hello, i m right here. 
summer: oh my god mom, so dramatic. 
jerry: wish i was on the island. same old smith family. 
morty: that was a clone. notice? didn t you 
jerry: wha-what s going on? 
beth: not really. 
jerry: thanks. just thanks. i m invisible. beth helps jerry up. i feel like he sits on the couch next to her. 
beth: don t be so melodramatic jerry. the important thing is we re all back together as a family. summer go get your father his drink. he s been through a lot today. and lets all enjoy what s on interdimensional cable. 
summer: okay. (to jerry) coffee?

announcement  (v. o.) : in a world where naked ambition, getting to the naked truth, with no naked fear, and during naked lunch. this summer comes a new mini-naked series. naked justice arrives with a naked explosion. the family paused; transfixed on the screen. a naked woman detective wears a fedora. cigarette hangs from her mouth. morty grabs a cushion and places it on his lap. 
[ext. naked street, fancy dress shop - night] 
naked woman detective stands in front of a shop door that has been broken. glass breaks inside along with objects that come crashing down. she touches the edge of broken glass. blood soaked fingers. and then looks at her 
naked woman detective: (shouts) i know you re in there. bring your naked ass out. throw your naked weapon away before you come out. the wind carries leaves, and brushes up against naked woman detective. her nipples spring up. 
morty  (o. s.) : oh god. a naked woman robber walks out with a gun in hand, and blood streaks over her body. 
naked woman robber: i never leave my naked gun alone. 
naked woman detective: you re not naked lesley. 
naked woman robber: i m naked. none of your god damn business. 
[int. smith residence, living room - evening] 
the words of naked justice cover the screen. 
announcement  (v. o.) : naked justice. 
rick: woah, first ball fondlers. now naked justice. amazing. morty uncomfortably shuffles on the spot. 
morty: yeah, they should do a cross over. 
rick: (laughs) yeah naked ball fondlers for justice. jerry sets his glass down. morty and rick stand up and step back. 
beth: going somewhere? jerry pauses. 
rick: emm i m a little tired. morty stretches his arms. 
morty: me too. school tomorrow. 
jerry: good night. jerry opens the bottle. the coke rumbles, then explodes into a huge geyser. rick and morty s eyes light up. 
morty: woah, it worked rick. this is the best part of my day. rick high fives morty. 
rick: science rules. summer, beth, and jerry are soaked. 
summer: what have you done rick? 
beth: so immature. 
jerry: worst day of my life. 
[int. smith household - morty’s room - day] 
morty is cleaning his room. rick enters. he has been looking for him. 
rick: oh, great morty, you re here. 
morty: hey, rick. 
rick: hey, buddy. i got something really neat to show you. it s a spectacle like nothing you ve ever seen before. (checks his watch) but we got to get going, as in now, otherwise we ll lose it. 
morty: i can t, rick. dad, summer and i are going to the park today. 
rick: (annoyed) uggh! stupid jerry. constant inconvenient. rick comes closer and puts his hand on morty s shoulder. morty, you really can t miss this! this is something special, morty. tell summer to deal with jerry on her own and hurry. he checks his watch again. 
morty: (curious but worried) i don t know, rick. my dad is waiting on me, and all. 
rick: don t worry about your dad, morty. you ll make up to him later. the park is boring, anyways. now come, before we miss our window. 
morty: what window? 
rick: of time. this special thing i want to show you, it happens once every year, morty. but it s in dorpuntzelp. their gravitational pulse is different from ours, morty. every year here is fifteen over there. it s quantum physics, morty. haven t you seen interstellar? it s the same principle. now go tell summer she ll have to deal with your dad solo. 
[int. smith household – dinner room – continuous] 
summer eats a bowl of cereal while typing on her smartphone, entertained. morty walks in. 
morty: hey... summer? i can t go with you today. she is pissed. 
summer: no way, morty! you promised me you would come. 
morty: yeah, well, rick said he, (scratches his neck) he said he needs me for a thing and i have to help him. 
summer: ugh! that s not fair! dad s been too clingy since the divorce. i don t want to put up with him alone. 
morty: oh, jeez, summer. you don t have to be so blunt, you know. i i rick walks in. 
rick: are you ready, morty? 
morty: yeah... 
rick: good. 
summer: rick, can t you do whatever it is you have to do on your own? 
rick: too late. i already bought our tickets and if there s one thing about dorpuntzelpians we all know is that they give no refunds. 
summer: what? rick walks away, but not before dismissing her. 
rick: don t be selfish, summer. me and morty, we take jerry away from you plenty of times. just do us a solid and try to keep your complaining to a minimum. he takes his portal gun out. summer surrenders, speechless. morty smiles. come on, morty. we have places to be. 4. he opens up a portal. rick walks into it, followed by morty. 
[ext. planet dorpuntzelp – day] 
rick and morty step out of a portal. morty is taken by surprise with how shinny and pretty everything in this world looks. 
rick: here we are, morty. oh, yeah! this is exciting! get ready to get you socks blown, son! 
morty: oh, boy, i sure am ready, rick. this place looks great! you were right, i had to see this. 
rick: wait until you see the best part. he takes a sip from his flask. 
rick: you won t believe your eyes, morty! morty smiles. rick looks around. after a brief beat, he senses something is off. 
rick: (scratching his chin) uhhh, that s strange. 
morty: what s the matter, rick? 
rick: nothing, nothing. (checks his watch) hey, morty, is today thursday? 
morty: no, rick. 5. 
rick: well, what day is it? 
morty: it s tuesday. 
rick: damn. i screwed the pooch. thought today was thursday. we came too early, morty. a month too early. 
morty: (confused) is this thing you want to show me seasonal, or something? 
rick: it s better than seasonal. it s a once every fifteen years event! lucky us, we get one every twelve months. he looks at a big screen on the side of a building, showing the news channel. (rolls his eyes) ughh, sandy crowswork. 
screen - news channel: on the screen, two dorpuntzelpians host the news. they look similar to humans, but their skin is red and their eyeballs are green. the news are presented in this very exciting and accelerated way, almost like a commercial, constantly trying to keep us hooked. 
steve: you know sandy? we know sandy! our latest poll puts sandy crowswork, the presidential pop singer candidate, ahead of actor celebrity von piturschmu, who has promised to release a new movie if elected! 6. 
susan: (to co-host) you know, steve, i m voting for sandy. (to camera) but don t let me persuade you! the hosts laugh, they sound genuine, but their laugh is false. 
steve: (to co-host) i know i won t, susan. (to camera) and don t forget to vote for your favorite candidate! one month left, and we ll know if we re getting a new movie or a new pop album! 
[ext. planet dorpuntzelp - continuous] 
rick: hmm. not good. 
[int. jerry’s apartment - kitchen – day] 
jerry is looking for a mug. he frenetically checks all drawers but cannot find it. 
jerry: where is it? the doorbell rings. jerry stops his search and walks to the door. 
[int. jerry’s apartment - entrance - continuous] 
the door opens. summer comes in, her eyes fixed on her smartphone. 
summer: (blunt) hi dad 
jerry: hey, sweetie. 7. he is glad to see her. summer walks by her father, into the small living room. 
[int. jerry’s apartment – living room – continuous] 
looking at the kitchen, summer notices many drawers are open, as a matter of fact, his whole apartment is disorganized. 
summer: what happened here? 
jerry: i m looking for my mug. 
summer: aren t all mugs here yours? 
jerry: (embarrassed) yeah... but one s dear to me. 
summer: (rolls her eyes) i m not even going to ask. she ignores the mess and resumes her deep interaction with her smartphone. 
jerry: where s morty? 
summer: he had to help grandpa rick with an assignment in dorpuntzomething. jerry is slightly disappointed hey, dad, since it s only the two of us, could we not go the park and instead go to the mall? 
jerry: uh, i guess we could do that... 
summer: yeah? 8. 
jerry: sure. why not. 
summer: (types on her phone) thanks. jerry smiles, happy and proud. 
[ext. planet dorpuntzelp – sidewalk - day] 
rick walks along the sidewalk. morty follows him, puzzled. 
morty: it s pretty weird that this dorpuntzelpians have celebrities running for president, huh, rick? 
rick: you would be surprised how much showbiz there is in politics, morty. the whole lunar race was basically a dick measuring contest. 
morty: and what was that about either getting a new movie or a new pop album? 
rick: that s why we re here, morty. dorpuntzelpians, they love their entertainment. they choose their leaders out of how offers the most exciting, entertaining thing, morty. 
morty: jeez, rick, that doesn t seem very wise, you know. 
rick: to each its own, morty. 
morty: so we re here to see that von guy s movie? 9. 
rick: you bet your ass we are. 
morty: and what if that sandy lady wins? 
rick: good thinking, morty. i was worried about that too, but then i thought, since we re here, we might as well make sure she doesn t. morty oh, jeez. not far ahead, on a street corner, there is a campaigner trying to charm in the passing crowd, asking for support, for his third party candidate. there is a small group of dorpuntzelpians near an improvised stage. morty notices the campaigner. he walks closer to him so he can listen to what is being said. as he arrives, the campaigner announces 
campaigner: now put your hands together for zizump slinton! from behind a curtain comes zizump slinton. he waves but 
the crowd is unimpressed. 
zizump: friends. comrades. thank you. thank you for joining me this afternoon. i m zizump slinton, and it would be my great pleasure to help you help yourselves. who is this character, thinks morty. we can t ignore the poverty and the sorrow hanging above our heads! we have become corrupt and we must change. change for better, my dear friends. change for better! perhaps, there is hope. morty calls for rick. 
morty: hey, rick! this guy seems to have some good ideas. 
rick: pass. he s just another pseudo-intellectual too obsessed with his own ideas to the point of thinking they have any worth. you got to be careful, morty, guys like him are always looking for a new way to screw you. zizump speaks directly to rick. 
zizump: you, friend, are you happy? 
rick: happiness is overrated. zizump chuckles, cordially. 
zizump: where are you from? 
rick: a miserable planet called none of your business. morty intervenes. 
morty: (to zizump) don t mind him, mr. slinton. my grandpa can t help but to be rude at all times. 
rick: hey, it s not my fault that this ring pop is snooping around, morty. indeed dorpunzelpians heads are shaped like a ring pop. a few of the crowd members scatter away. 
zizump: (to morty) you re a brave young man, aren t you? morty is radiant hearing this question. 
rick: careful. 
zizump: (to the crowd) let us be more like our young friend! zizump s campaigner begins to clap, euphorically. the remaining attendees clap uncomfortably, slow claps, half-confused. 
morty: (to zizump) you re running for president? 
zizump: that i am. 
morty: and you re not offering entertainment? 
zizump: i m afraid not. zizump s campaigner intervenes. 
campaigner: mr. slinton is actually trying to make things better, he is. 
morty: hey, rick, what do you say we help this guy out instead? he might be a better choice for president, you know. 
rick: that s horrible thinking, morty. these guys are all the same. they ramble and ramble and end up killing millions because of their idiosyncrasies. 
morty: hey, don t be like that, rick. maybe, maybe he s actually good. 
rick: but think about their movies, morty. they ve mastered the art of entertainment! they, they, they can t help it, morty! and von s movies, they top them all, morty! we re missing a spectacle here, a spectacle! ask zump pop. 
morty: (freaking out) that doesn t matter, rick! i mean, this is this is kangaroo democracy, rick! we got to do something, don t we? at least get their attention. 
rick: all right, all right, morty, we ll play che guevara, if that means soooo much to you. morty is glad. 
morty: (to zizump) hey, mr. slinton, what do you say we help you out with your campaign? 
zizump: all help is good help, friend. 
campaign montage:-rick and morty distributing pamphlets on the street.-rick and morty on a bridge. a spy approaches them and hands morty an envelope with dirty documents of the opposing party. -rick and morty torturing a dorpunzelpian prisioner for information. 
rick: (to their prisoner) tell us who sandy s featuring artists are! 
prisoner: (bloddy, crying, miserable) i don t know! rick punches his face. 
[int. channel news broadcasting office – day] 
‘the morning show with steve and susan’ is live and zizump is their next guest. rick and morty walk in. they are off stage, watching from far, as the show is being made. morty is well invested in zizump‟s campaign. he looks worn out, but confident. the show goes to commercial break. 
morty: (to rick) this is going pretty well, huh, rick? 
rick: don t pop your zits yet, morty. steve and susan, the lively hosts of the channel, whom we have seen previously, chit-chat with zizump before the camera rolls. 
morty: you know, i think we have a shot at winning this whole shebang. 
rick: we? christ, morty, have a little disassociation! the morning show with steve and susan is about to continue. the broadcasting supervisor shouts 
supervisor: alright, everybody. shut up! crickets. 
[the morning show with steve and susan – intro - continuous] 
the show‟s logo fades out and our hosts welcome us back with a big smile. 
susan: and we re back. with us, we have candidate zizump slinton, who joined us this morning for us to get to know him... there is a beat. james 
susan: a little better. a little better. we get a sense that this is their catch phrase. they giggle after. welcome, zizump. 
zizump: (nods politely) happy to be here. 
susan: so, politics. is that something we need? the audience laughs. 
zizump: i believe so, yes. 
steve: quick question, what s your favorite celebrity? a loud bang surprises everyone. zizump screams in agony. 
zizump: ahhhh! he was shot. 
morty: oh, my god, no! everyone but rick freaks out. the audience scatters, afraid. security rushes in. the shooter is a member of the audience. two security guards point their pistols at the shooter. 
guard: halt! the shooter looks at zizump, then he shoots himself. his body falls, lifeless. morty runs to zizump and kneels next to him-his hero is suffering. morty holds zizump s head, and looks up, at rick. 
morty: how could this happen? 
rick: it was pretty expectable, morty. i mean, zizump is a revolutionary candidate. and just so you know, major parties don t necessarily play, (air quotes) fair . 
morty: oh, jeez, rick. i didn t think something like this could happen! zizump is gushing out blood. in pain, crying. 
assistant: he s losing so much blood. 
morty: rick? can you help him? please? 
rick: you think i carry some miraculous cure to internal bleedings everywhere i go? i mean, i m not mary poppins, morty. he takes his hand into his pocket. luckily, i have the next best thing. he pulls a small spray bottle out of his pocket. rick bends down and sprays zizump s wound. there. that should delay the bleeding until he gets to a hospital. 
[int. smith household – kitchen - afternoon] 
beth and davin enjoy a good conversation by the cooking table, each with a glass of red wine in hand. davin takes a sip from his wine and decides to make a move on beth. 
davin: beth, have you ever seen two horses making love? beth is slightly grossed out by his question. nevertheless, she carries on. 
beth: (drinks) can t say i have, no. 
davin: oh, it s wonderful! so tender. so precious. the way they friction their bodies against each other. aw! it changed me as man. 
beth: sounds... interesting. davin promptly takes his smartphone out. 
davin: (excited) here, i can show you! he is not very smooth. summer walks by. the thought of davin with her mother is nauseating to her teenage existence, and so, she walks out, containing her opinion. beth follows her, while davin searches for whatever he is searching on his smartphone. 
[int. smith household – entrance – continuous] 
beth catches summer before she goes upstairs. 
beth: hey, summer? 
summer: what? 
beth: i just... i wanted to know how you were. 
summer: i ll be fine once i get to my room. 
beth: (curious and sincere) and, huh, how s jerry? 
summer: dad has lost it. i found him looking for some mug when he had like three on the counter. 
beth: oh. 
summer: i told him to buy a new one, but he got all weird and said it doesn t work like that . this however, rings a happy bell on beth s heart. can i go now? beth nods, approving. summer climbs the stairs. beth takes a sip from her wine, pondering. 
[int. hospital - zizump’s room – day] 
a dorpunzelpian doctor tells an injured zizump, lying in bed, what has happened to him. 
doctor: your liver was ruptured. you lost a substantial amount of blood. fortunately, we ve managed to regenerate your liver s tissue, and you should be walking in about a week. i say fortunately because had your bleeding not been stagnated, and we wouldn t have had time to intervene. everyone is relieved. in fact, if it wasn t for your friend s intervention, by now, you would be dead. zizump looks at rick, gratefully. 
zizump: thank you, rick. 
rick: (unimpressed) whatever. i m going to watch the news. maybe i ll hear something that s actually new. he walks out of frame, and toward the hospital s lobby. sandy crowswork walks in. she looks like a sexist s wet dream, with a tight waist and a large cleavage-a futile celebrity, seemingly nice. following her are two cameramen, with cameras in hand, impatiently looking for good angles to shoot sandy s existence from. zizump is surprised to see sandy, but morty is mesmerized, his hormones jumping. 
sandy: oh, thank zorpoid, you re okay. she walks up to zizump and puts her hand on top of his. i hope you don t mind me coming by, but, oh, i got so worried i just had to. 
zizump: worried? about me? 
sandy: yes! it just breaks my heart to see such a kind person suffering. she looks at the cameras, aware of the public opinion. sandy faces morty. you must be morty. i ve heard a lot of good things about you. 
morty: (embarrassed) you, you have? she caresses his face. morty is in awe. 
sandy: sure did. 
[int. hospital - lobby – continuous] 
all seems peaceful. rick gets a soda from the vending machine. then, he walks over to a row of chairs and sits down. he opens his soda. rick is about to take his first sip, but a large explosion by the elevator makes him spill his soda. a dozen of dorpunzelpian „terrorists‟ storms in, well- armed, to conclude zizump‟s assassination. five security guards move forward and draw their guns. shootout. 
[int. hospital – zizump’s room – continuous] 
panic has taken over - we hear screams and bullets being shot. sandy is frightened, while morty is unshaken. 
sandy: what do we do? 
zizump: (heroically) you two must go! get out of here! i m the one they re after. 
sandy: no! we must stick together. we re safer that way. 
zizump: you must. i couldn t bear to have the blood of others spilled because of me. sandy is moved. she takes her hand to her chest. 
sandy: that s noble. morty, however, is about to take action he walks toward the door. (to morty) what are you doing? 
morty: i m going to get rick. he ll know how to get us out safe. zizump looks like a proud father. morty s courage is admirable, he thinks. close the door after i leave. and if someone knocks, you know, ask who it is before you open up. morty rushes out. 
[int. hospital - lobby – continuous] 
chaos reigns. bullets shot in every direction; a waiting patient complaining about his arm gets shot in his arm; a guard drops dead; four dorpunzelpians jump on a „terrorist‟, while a bullet perforates his eyeball. morty gets to rick. 
morty: rick! 
rick: oh, good, morty, you re fine. i thought you might have blown up, or something. 
morty: rick, we got to do something! 
rick: you re right, morty. they-they made me spill my soda, morty! no one makes me spill my soda and gets away with it! 
morty: what? no! they came to kill zizump! 
rick: i don t know, morty. i ve had people go to great lengths to make me spill something. 
morty: rick! be serious for a minute! 
rick: alright, morty, alright! just, chill-i-o! naturally, rick grabs a gun from the floor and hands it to morty. here. go guard your friend while i squanch these fools. morty nods and heads back to zizump s room. rick draws his laser gun and begins to deal with the terrorists. he has a great start, with a wonderful headshot. oh yeah! spill that, motherfucker! 
[int. smith household – kitchen - night] 
davin has left and beth is washing the used glasses before bed. done washing, she dries them with a towel. she opens the cabinet above her head and puts the glasses on a shelf. beth noticed a grand canyon souvenir mug, green, behind other cups - immediately, she knows this is the mug jerry is looking for. in an act of kindness, she reaches for it and takes it out of the cabinet. with the mug in her hands, she ponders. 
beth: i m going to regret this. 
[int. hospital - lobby – day] 
three terrorists left. rick manages to kill one, while the remaining two shoot back, hitting rick‟s laser gun. his laser gun drifts along the floor. rick has been effectively disarmed. 
rick: shit! he runs for cover, and finds it behind the front desk. bullets keep making holes. rick is cornered by two gun blazing killers. he looks around for a solution. then, rather quickly, rick builds an adapter for his portal gun and attaches it to its rectangular barrel. he leaps to his left and shoots his portal gun. the adapter divides the portal s blast in two two portals open under rick s enemies. they fall through the portals, and into a different dimensions. 
[int. hospital – zizump’s room – continuous] 
sandy hides behind the side of zizump‟s bed. 
sandy: this is insane! who could be so cruel as to want us dead! 
zizump: not, us, sandy. me. 
sandy: oh, i bet von is behind this. 
zizump: we can t be so imprudent as to rely on assumptions. 
sandy: why don t you just drop out of the election? if you did so, they would probably spare you, don t you think? 
zizump: i appreciate your worry, sandy, but i can t do such a thing. i m a man of conviction, and so, what will be will be. his reply seems to have annoyed sandy. suddenly, a grenade blows the door up, along with the two cameramen. a terrorist runs in, ready to kill. there is a beat. bang, morty shoots the terrorist from behind he falls forward, on his chest. morty rushes in, worried. 
morty: are you okay? they are. sandy looks disappointed, a subtle expression, one she quickly hides. morty looks at the dead terrorist. oh man, these guys really are serious about killing you, huh? it s just like everywhere else! sandy rolls her eyes. 
sandy: (with disdain) ugh... she pulls a pistol from underneath her volumptuous hairdoand aims it at morty. 
morty: what are you doing? 
sandy: winning. 
morty: you... you... you can t do this! 
sandy: (shocked) are you telling me what i can and can t do? do you think i m in some way incapable because i have a vagina? 
morty: what? no! i... i didn t mean it like that! 
sandy: you re a fool if you think i m willing to risk my fame for some silly man s ideas. 
morty: really? do you only care about yourself? it s not like you re the most important being in the universe, you know. maybe you could allow someone else to have a say! 
sandy: oh, spare me, kid! you really think he wants what s best for people? he wants what s best for him, just like everybody else! at least i provide entertainment, which is far more than what he would! zizump smirks. 
zizump: and here i was, questioning my mattering. 
sandy: no need to question it, sweetheart. you don t! you re just a phase! i matter! not you! 
morty: let him live, then! 
sandy: and let dorpuntzelpians decide my fate? please! you can t trust people, morty. 
zizump: i suppose that s where we differ. 
sandy: is that an assumption, zizump? we can t be so imprudent as to rely on assumptions, remember? she smiles, malevolently, she, the holder of truth. after all, if you were so different, so willing to trust others, you wouldn t try to change a thing! morty becomes aware that despite his intentions, zizump might very well not be much better than sandy. now excuse me, as i take charge. triumphantly, sandy aims at zizump, but before she shoots him, rick shoots her. sandy drops dead, to the shock of both morty and zizump. 
rick: jeez, what an egotistical princess. as usual, rick looks numb, while the rest process his act. you know, i usually try to keep myself away from situations such as this, but i actually think i made this world a great favor this time around. i feel good about it. you guys will be way better off without her music. (looks at zizump) and, huh, i don t want to say it, but you could thank me, you know. or you could, maybe, quit, so my grandson and i can enjoy what we came here for. morty looks at rick in a disapproving matter. i m just saying, it would be highly appreciated if he did that. it s not like he can run in good conscience anymore. 
[int. jerry’s apartment - entrance – day] 
the doorbell rings. jerry opens up - a mailman stands in front of him. 
mailman: jerry smith? 
jerry: speaking. 
mailman: yeah, that s a phone thing, buddy. you don t say that face to face. 
jerry: oh. 
mailman: this is for you. he hands a package to jerry. just sign here. he then turns his tablet to jerry so he can electronically sign for his package. jerry does so.
mailman: okay. have a good day. the mailman turns around and leaves. jerry closes the door. curious, he opens the package-wrapped in bubble wrap, to find his missing mug, a grand canyon souvenir. he turns the mug upside down, revealing a sentence engraved on the bottom 
(jerry and beth survived the grand canyon. hopeful, he smiles.)
[int. smith’s household – garage – day] 
a portal opens up. from it come rick and morty, both wearing t-shirts and accessories promoting von‟s electoral movie. 
rick: so what did you think, morty? amazing spectacle, right? 
morty: yeah, rick, it was pretty cool. but, you know, i m still a little shook up with what happened. it s really hard to believe that after all that, people chose von over zizump. 
rick: it s like they say, morty, if it ain t broke, don t fix it . hey, at least we got to shoot a couple of baddies, including that sandy character. morty smiles, but his smile is a little empty. rick notices this and is sympathetic. i bet she catchphrased after she pulled her gun on you. 
morty: it was more of a catchword. she said winning . 
rick: oh, wow, how unique. hey, morty, ask me what i think she was. 
morty: what do you think she was? 
rick: dumb. morty's smile is a little brighter. 
[int. morty's bedroom - night] 
morty lays down in his bed with a peaceful smile on his face and swiftly falls asleep. a moment later the silence of the room is broken by a ghostly apparition that appears with a shriek. 
morty: holy crap! what the..? morty shrinks under his covers as this green pulsating anomaly pulls closer. after a few seconds it abruptly disappears. morty sits frozen in shock staring at the corner of the room it came from until his alarm goes off the next morning. 
[int. rick's garage - day] 
morty walks wide-eyed into the garage while rick is building a contraption on his work bench. 
morty: uhh.. rick i need your help with something, i'm freaking out a little. 
rick: you're always freaking out morty. i've learned to tune it out. 
morty: i think i saw a ghost in my room last night. 
rick: a ghost? don't be an idiot, ghosts aren't real. 
morty: are you sure? because i thought vampires weren't real but then, you know, we found one at my school remember? and we had to kill it. remember that? rick yes morty, vampires are real. and do you wanna know an interesting bit of trivia about vampires? 
morty: uhh, sure? 
rick: they don't believe in ghosts, because vampires aren't idiots. 
morty: rick will you please just help me! something came into my room last night and it looked a lot like you'd.. think a ghost would look, so i just-- 
rick:--ugh alright alright. pipe down already. on the off chance that this"ghost"of yours is real, i ll make you a uhhh, anti-ghost... uhh.. bullet. rick starts making the bullet on his work bench. 
morty: oh, okay i guess... how would a bullet kill a ghost? 
rick: well when you gotta kill a werewolf you use silver bullets right? this is the same, you know, similar kind of thing. morty wait, werewolves are real? 
rick: of course not morty! don't be an idiot! okay there, done. rick loads the anti-ghost bullet into a revolver he pulls from an ankle holster. he tosses it over his shoulder to morty without looking. 
rick: the first bullet in there is a psychokinetic round that should kill any apparition-ey kind of thing you come across. next time the ghost shows up, just hit it with that. 
morty: cool, thank's rick. 
rick: don't mention it. oh and be careful, the second bullet is a regular one. 
[int. dining room - day] 
beth is carrying suitcases in both hands fumbling to open the front door. jerry is following behind carrying a third. 
beth: what are you holding? 
jerry:... it's your other suitcase--beth--are you kidding me jerry? you're seriously carrying my bag to the car? you're actually helping me leave? 
jerry: what i, i'm just trying to be nice. 
beth: i'm leaving to spite you jerry! i don't want you to be nice! i want you to be upset! i'm so sick of you smothering me! 
jerry: if you're intentionally trying to upset me how am i the bad guy? 
beth: questions like that are exactly why i need space! beth slams the door in jerry's face and is heard peeling out of the driveway. rick walks past him to the table and sits down. 
jerry: what is wrong with me? i can never tell what she wants. 
rick: i've got a secret for you jerry, she doesn't decide what she wants you to do until you've already done something. jerrywhat? 
rick: if you didn't help her with her bags she'd accuse you of being selfish and say that's why she's leaving. since you did help, she went with the smothering thing instead. and the only common factor here is your willingness to internalize any shit that gets pushed your way. jerry drops the suitcase, hangs his head, and turns to walk away. rick notices and rolls his eyes in irritation. 
rick: ugghh. okay jerry i ll tell you what. you guys divorcing would be pretty inconvenient to my living situation so i ve got an idea. 
jerry: oh yeah? what? 
rick: you need some perspective. so let's me and you right now go to the best strip club in the multi-verse! 
jerry: i don't think so. 
rick: she said it herself didn't she? she needs space. jerryright but i don't-- 
rick:--so if going to stay with a friend that lives eight blocks from here is helping, then obviously going to a galactic strip club twenty lightyears away would work even better! 
jerry: yeah but when she said space i don t think she was referring to like, physical distance right? it s more of a figurative thing isn't it? 
rick: can't sneak anything past you jerry. okay how about this. you like star wars right? 
jerry: yeah. 
rick: you know how star wars takes place long ago in a galaxy far far away? 
jerry: yeah. 
rick: spend two hours at the strip club and i'll take you to that galaxy. jerryno way! really! can we go to endor? 
rick: sure whatever. do we have a deal? 
jerry: yeah! i have to go get my jedi robes! jerry excitedly runs out of the room. 
rick: jesus christ jerry, endor? no wonder she left. 
[int. morty's bedroom - day] 
morty's alarm goes off and he hits the snooze. as he lays back down, the apparition appears and disappears with a groan. morty grabs ricks revolver off his side-table and nervously scans the room. 
morty: uhh, ghost thing? if you've got like, unfinished business or whatever, that's fine. i just, i can't have you sneaking into my room while i'm sleeping. the ball of green light shimmers into existence again and softly whispers"morty"in a garbled female voice. 
morty: oh god it knows my name. okay for real, if you come in here i have to shoot you! you're no different than any other home intruder, okay? you don't get like, special treatment just because you're dead. so, leavenow. the ball is getting bigger and louder as it starts to move towards the bed. morty aims the revolver and fires. but instead of bullets, confetti sprays out. a fabric sign that reads"ghosts aren't real idiot"is sticking out of the barrel. 
morty: damn it rick! the ball of light is no longer transparent and begins whirring like an engine. it splits into two halves which then meld back together. this repeats over and over with increasing speed until the ball collapses into a flat off-green portal. summer appears in the portal and reaches out to morty. 
summer: morty! help! 
morty: summer!? morty grabs summer's outstretched hand and pulls her out of the portal, which implodes and disappears behind her. 
morty: summer what the hell are you doing!? 
summer: morty! it's so good to see you! man it feels really weird to say that. summer brushes herself off. the sides of her head are shavedand when she stands up morty notices that she has a wooden peg leg. 
morty: what are you doing? where did that portal come from? 
summer: it's me morty! your real sister! 
morty: my... what? 
summer: you don't remember? morty stares blankly back at summer. 
summer: (annoyed) i'm your original sister from the dimension that got cronenberg'd. 
morty: uhhh... 
summer: remember? i mean i'm just assuming that it was you and grandpa rick that destroyed the world with one of your dumb experiments right? everyone got turned into cronenberg monsters? (beat) are you kidding me morty? are we really going to have to flashback to it? 
morty: no no wait! oh right! i remember! how did you get here? what happenedto your foot? 
summer: walk with me, i want to get this done quick. is rick here? 
morty: no he's out. get what done? where are we going? summer pulls a shotgun out of a holster on her back and smashes open the door to summer's bedroom with her peg leg. 
[int. summer's bedroom] 
summer: freeze bitch! 
morty: what the hell are you doing? summer scans the room and puts her gun away when she sees no one is there. 
summer: where is she? summer starts rifling through drawers and closets in the bedroom. she grabs a diary and puts it in her back pocket. 
morty: she's at the mall. 
summer: which mall? 
morty: the one by the... wait why? 
summer: so i can kill her and take herplace in this dimension. 
morty: wh-what! you can't do that! 
summer: why not? isn't that exactly what you and grandpa did? 
morty: no they were already dead when we got here! we didn't kill anyone! 
summer: yeah you"didn't kill anyone"except for almost every single person on earth when you cronenberg'd it. 
morty: that was an accident! summer walks to the garage, morty chases behind. 
[int. rick's garage] 
morty: hey wait! 
summer: an"accident"is when you run over a fire hydrant with your car. mutating and killing everyone on earth is criminal negligence. you'd be thrown in jail for it if there were any cops left to take you there. mortywe're not supposed to be in here summer! the garage is off limits, rick has been like, super clear on that. summer slides some junk out of the way to get to ricks safe. she punches in the code waits for the long and loud unlocking process to finish. 
morty: how do you know the password? 
summer: i had lots of time to guess it morty. or do you really not realize how long it's been since you abandoned me in a dimension of monsters? the safe door swings open and morty creeps towards it to peer inside. summer grabs him by the scruff of his shirt and yanks him back. a buzz-saw blade at shin level shoots out of the base of the safe narrowly missing morty's leg. 
summer: (taps peg leg with knuckles) yeah i learned that one the hard way. summer kneels down to look into the safe. the only thing inside is a stack of porn magazines. she rolls her eyes and tosses them over her shoulder revealing a button beneath. when pressed an impossibly long drawer slides out of the safe. she reaches into it and pulls out a shiny new portal gun, which she uses to fire a portal at the wall. summeryes! finally! summer pulls a yellow-tinged decrepit portal gun wrapped in duct tape out of her satchel and throws it aside. 
summer: you have no idea what a hassle it was getting here. summer walks over to morty, shotgun in one hand and new portal gun in the other. 
summer: where is she? 
[int. human-boobs strip club - night] 
rick and jerry walk through "human-boobs", the human themed alien strip club. jerry is wearing his jedi robes. 
rick: alright what do you think! 
jerry: how much longer? 
rick: two hours was the deal. and the timer doesn't start until you stop complaining. here check this out! rick leads jerry over to two vending machines under a sign that reads"fantasy scanner". 
rick: this machine will scan your brain for your dirtiest, raunchiest fantasy and then put you in a virtual reality world where you can experience it! 
jerry: yeah i don't know if i want to--rick slams a brain scanner on jerry's head and puts another on his own. two flashes go off and the machine spits out two tickets. 
rick: alright lets do this! here's yours. just go in that booth and put this ticket in the machine. rick hands jerry a ticket and the two walk into separate booths. rick puts his ticket in and hit's the"start"button. the walls of the booth fade away. 
[int. virtual reality strip club] 
rick is sitting in front of a stage watching a blonde stripper pole-dance. 
rick: this is it? i feel like my brain can be a lot raunchier than this. when the stripper turns around rick sees it's a virtual reality beth. 
rick: oh jesus christ! 
beth: hey there handsome.. rick slams the stop button and the booth reappears around him. 
[int. human-boobs strip club] 
rick: what the hell is this!? he pulls the ticket back out of the machine. it's stamped with a picture of jerry. rickoh god damn it. you grabbed the wrong ticket jerry, you idiot! arrg it's going to take me forever to get that image out of my head. rick gets out of his booth and starts walking around to jerry's. 
rick: and is your raunchiest fantasy seriously your own wife stripping for you? i mean there's"vanilla"and then there's"flavorless". jerry crawls out of the booth in a state of shock clenching the other ticket in his hand. he's shivering so hard he has trouble standing up. 
rick: oh boy. how we doin'jerry? you okay? what did you see? jerry slowly turns his thousand yard stare towards rick. 
rick: can you hear me jerry? do you still want to go to endor? jerry shakes his head no. 
rick: you want to get a drink? 
jerry: yes. drink now. liquor now. rickokay pal, here we go. this way. yeah i'm actually not sure which one of us was more traumatized by this. 
[int. rick's garage - day] 
morty backs away from summer until he bumps into the wall behind him. 
summer: which mall did she go to? 
morty: i uhh.. i don't think i should tell you. i.. i can't just let you kill her. 
summer: why? apparently you were okay with leaving me to die. we're interchangeable to you so what's the difference? 
morty: i mean, i don't know, it feels weird. she was here when mr. poopybutthole got shot, and when we ruptured space time and all that. we've like, been through stuff together, you know? 
summer: don't worry, i'll read all about it. summer tosses the diary up and down in her hand. 
summer: okay look morty i'm super sorry you made memories with your new fake sister, but you do realize that they'd be our memories if you had come back to get me in the first place right? this is your mess i'm cleaning up, so you could at least tell me where she is. 
morty: i.. i don't.. i just, we should wait for rick to get back. 
summer: oh, i get it. that's the difference isn't it? this time you would have to be the one to take responsibility. 
morty: what? 
summer: because thats what s important to you morty. you don t care if your sister dies or gets marooned in a hell dimension forever so long as you aren't morally culpable for it. you ll let rick do whatever needs to be done, and then tell yourself you d have done different so you can maintain your self-image as a good person. 
morty: no no that's not-- 
summer:--well i got news for you! your complete indifference to your sister s suffering makes you a bad person whether you are the one causing it or not! it would have taken like, two minutes to come get me. you re no better than grampa-rick, except he doesn t claim to be a good person. 
morty: i don t know! it s really confusing! this is all being dropped on me at once you know?. i m sorry we didn t come back for you, i realize that was wrong now. but p.. please, you can t kill my sister-- 
summer:--i m your sister! and i want my life back! if you've got another solution let's hear it. 
morty: can't you like, just say you're her long lost twin or something? you know? you guys could like, get a bunk bed or-- 
summer:--i'm not sharing a room with that bitch! why should i be the one that has to live half a life? and i'm not asking for your blessing on this, if you won't help me i llfind her myself. summer shoots a portal and tries to jump through it. morty tackles her and knocks the portal-gun out of her hand. the portal closes and the two wrestle for control of the gun. after a short scuffle summer tosses morty off of her and pulls out her shotgun. morty backs away and puts his hands up. summer wipes blood off her lip. 
summer: why didn't you fight this hard for me morty? summer opens a portal and jumps through. morty is left alone in the garage. 
morty: no! 
[int. human-boobs strip club bar] 
jerry is slumped over the bar and barely present. rick pats him on the back. 
rick: okay jerry, i don't know exactly what you saw in there but it's probably best for both of us if you forget it, so take these. rick pours three vials of glowing liquid into jerry's glass. the substance violently fizzles and and steams on contact. 
rick: this will make you forget everything that happened today. drink it. jerry snatches the glass off the table chugs the entire thing in one gulp. 
jerry: this stuff better work. what's it called? 
rick: it's called a roofie jerry. i bought them from the bum behind the seven-eleven. rick's phone gets a call from morty. 
rick: what up. 
morty: rick come quick! i need your help! come to the garage! 
rick: i'm twenty lightyears away, can this wait? 
morty: no come to the garage! hurry! 
rick: uggh. rick hangs up the phone and shoots a portal. jerry is lying face down on the bar top. 
rick: hold on a sec i'll be right back. and try not to swallow your tongue. int. rick's garage-day 
a portal opens in the garage and rick steps out of it still holding his cocktail. 
rick: alright, what's so important. 
morty: i don t have time to explain, i need you to portal me somewhere! 
rick: that s why you called me here? do you see me wearing a chauffeur hat morty? 
morty: rick! 
rick: no you don t. and there s a very specific reason for that. 
morty: it s an emergency! 
rick: no an emergency is what you called me away from. your dad is alone in an alien bar having a mental breakdown. it's not a safe place for someone in his state of mind. or just his mind in general. 
morty: you don t understand! the version of my sister we left behind on the world we rick--i don t have time for exposition morty, just tell me where you want to go. 
morty: the mall downtown. 
rick: the mall? are you kidding me? what kind of emergency could possibly necessitate you going to the mall?. you run out of yellow shirts? rick punches buttons into his portal gun and fires a portal onto the wall. 
rick: there. don't ever pull this crap again morty. 
morty: thanks rick! morty jumps through the portal, rick shouts after him. 
rick: and my garage is off limits by the way! i thought i ve been like, super clear on that! 
[int. mall - day] 
morty rushes through the mall shouting for summer while trying to call her on his phone. 
[ext. mall courtyard - day] 
summer sees that morty is calling, and rolls her eyes before hitting ignore. a shadowy figure walks up behind her. 
[int. mall - daymorty] 
damn it summer pick up the phone! you're going to stuck-up yourself to death! morty hears a shriek on the second level of the mall and runs up the escalator. when he reaches the top he sees the source of the shriek is an obnoxious ad display. out the window, he spots summer on the ground in the courtyard below surrounded by paramedics. 
morty: oh god no! morty rushes back down stairs but gets stuck on a crowded escalator. by the time he gets outside, the ambulance is rushing off with summer inside. morty takes the space phone out of his pocket and tries to call rick again. while waiting for rick to answer, he sees an empty car idling nearby with keys in it's ignition. 
morty: pick up, pick up, pick up! 
[int. human-boobs strip club bar - day] 
rick sees that morty is calling, and rolls his eyes before hitting ignore. 
rick: how we doing man? 
jerry: you were right rick. she walks on me because i let her. and she hates me because i let her. 
rick: of course i was right. jerryshe doesn't want a sidekick, she wants a partner. and i've always known that but it's scary to rock the boat when our relationship is hanging on by a thread. right now she hates me, but not enough to leave. what if the transition from the jerry i am to an assertive jerry she'd like more is so rocky she leaves before it's over? 
rick: life is risk jerry, you'll get there one day. 
jerry: are you kidding? i'm there now. beth leaving me isn't half as terrifying as what i saw here today. 
rick: well let's not be dramatic. 
jerry: i could walk in on her having a threesome with my parents and it would only be the second most shocking thing i've seen in my life. i mean seriously what is wrong with your brain? 
rick: my brain? glass houses jerry. jerryno, i'm not going to settle for the bare minimum anymore. for her sake and mine, i'm going to be better. i'm going to make myself the man we both want me to be! 
rick: i m really happy you had this little break through jerry, but i'll remind you that you took a triple dose of roofies like half an hour ago. so try to enjoy your new perspective while you can still remember it. 
jerry: oh that's right. hey, do you have like, a pen or something? 
[ext. hospital parking lot - day] 
morty slams his stolen car into a fire hydrant outside the hospital and rushes inside. 
[int. summers hopsital room - day] 
morty is panting and can barely talk when he gets to summer's bedside. she is unconscious with a bandage wrapped around her head. 
morty: oh god, what happened? 
doctor: some psycho attacked her with a machete and ran off. are you family? 
morty: yes she's my sister. is she going to be--morty trails off when he sees that summer's foot has beencut off. 
morty: what? no, no! i don't understand! morty backs slowly into the hallway in a state of shock. down the hall behind him, a silhouette of a person holding a portal gun stands watching. when morty notices, he bolts the other way. a portal is shot open in his path. he tries to slow down to avoid it but topples over the edge and falls in. 
[ext. wasteland - sunset] 
morty falls out of the portal and slams into the ground. summer drops out shortly after brandishing her shotgun. 
morty: y.. you cut off her leg. why did you do that!? 
summer: think about it dum-dum, how else could i explain this to everyone? summer gestures to her peg leg. 
summer: not only am i all of a sudden inexplicably missing a foot, but it's also already healed completely? people would ask questions. 
morty: but i.. there has got to be a better way. 
summer: the better way was for you and grandpa rick to find a dimension with room for the whole family in the first place. now there's justthis. morty looks around at the vast desert surrounding him. 
morty: where are we? 
summer: guess. while taking in his surroundings morty backs into something. he turns to see three crude tombstones, two bearing his parents names, and a third that reads"fake summer"over an open grave. 
morty: oh god! summer this is crazy! this is insane! 
summer: the universe is crazy morty, it's best to just not think about it. summer puts her shotgun back in its holster, and sits down leaning against a boulder. she pulls out the diary and starts flipping through it. 
summer: i need you to answer some questions for me. what does she mean by"worked for the devil?". was that like a nickname or something? morty is staring awestruck at the graves. 
summer: morty! focus! are you going to help me or not? considering this is all your fault anyway i feel like it'sthe least you can do. 
morty: wh.. what happens now? 
summer: what happens now is i wait. in a few months when fake summer's leg is healed i'll portal into her room one night while everyone's sleeping and... well, you get the idea. (beat) and the next morning life will carry on like normal. no one will know it happened. not even you. 
morty: so every time i go to bed from now on i'm just going to be laying there not knowing if you're down the hall at that very moment murdering my sister? h.. how am i supposed to sleep at night? 
summer: i don't know how you slept at night before knowing you left me here. 
morty: i can't let-- 
summer:--this is happening morty. there's nothing you can do about it now. 
morty: w.. well, maybe i'll tell rick! i'll tell him you broke into hissafe! y.. you think he's gonna be okay with some, rouge summer going around with a stolen portal gun killing people? 
summer: well, do whatever you think is right. after a long silence summer looks up from the diary to see morty staring transfixed at the gravesite. she shakes her head in annoyance and fires a portal next to him. 
summer: go home morty. morty lingers for a moment, looking longingly at the graves before dejectedly walking into the portal. 
summer: i'll see you real soon. 
[ext. smith house front yard - sunset] 
morty steps out of the portal into the driveway. he takes out his phone to see dozens of texts telling him to come to the hospital. he puts his hands in his pockets and starts walking down the sidewalk. 
[ext. hospital parking lot - night] 
morty walks by the car he crashed, which is being loaded onto a tow truck. water is spewing out of the broken hydrant. 
[int. summers hopsital room - night] 
morty walks into the hospital room. beth and rick are sitting on either side of summer's bed. jerry comes in with coffee for everyone, beth shoots him a loving smile as he hands her a cup. jerry sits down next to rick. 
rick: see jerry? all you needed was some space. also i guess a massivetragedy never hurts when trying to bring people together. kind of got lucky with the timing on that one. summer is leafing through a catalog of prosthetic legs. morty walks over to rick and tugs on his jacket. 
morty: rick i.. i need to talk to you. 
rick: jesus, you look like hell. 
morty: just come on already. the two walk out into the hallway. 
rick: what morty, is there another emergency ? where do you have to go this time? amusement park? 
morty: no i.. begin flashback-beth and jerry's gravesite morty recalls the transcription on the memorial plate at the gravesite, which reads it took the world ending to bring us together, and now, once again, we re apart. here lies jerry and beth smith. the best, albeit only, parents on earth. one way or another, i ll be with you again soon.-summer smith"back to scene 
morty: i uhh.. 
rick: jesus morty only you could stutter when not speaking. morty 
i.. : morty lets out a defeated sigh and hangs his head. 
morty: nothing. i don't know. never mind. morty walks back into the hospital room and sits next to his sister. 
rick: i love our little talks morty! rick snags a bouquet of flowers off a passing cart and brings them to summer. 
morty sits in the middle of the table as rick, summer, jerry, and beth stand around him singing happy birthday. there is a cake in the middle of the table. 
rick,  summer,  jerry,    beth: happy birthday to morty. happy birthday to you! before morty can blow the candles out, rick fires air from a pistol that extinguishes the flames. 
rick: alright come on morty. you re going to love my present, morty. 
jerry: now hold on. we re his parents so he should open our gift first. 
rick: please, jerry. all morty is to you is a get out a jail free card. jail being a burp divorce. 
jerry: (defensive) what s that supposed to mean? 
rick: nothing. fine. open your stupid present from your stupid parents. they probably got you a scooter or something. beth hands morty the present. he opens it. 
morty: oh wow, a ripstik! 
rick: an even more convolutedly stupid piece of transportation. if you wanted him to look like a fairy you should ve gotten him a hula burp hoop. 
summer: my gift isn t just stuff. my gift is invaluable yet priceless at the same time. i will be giving morty life lessons for the next year."morty's castle" 
beth: you really broke the bank this year, summer. beth picks up dishes and exits for the kitchen. 
rick: mediocre fun is over. time for real fun. go to my lab, morty. you can go too summer. give morty some of your wisdom or whatever it was. morty and summer exit for the lab. rick starts to follow but jerry stops him. 
jerry: hey, what did you mean by get out of jail free card? 
rick: jesus jerry, you re really going to make me spell it out for you, aren t ya? the only reason beth is still with you is for the kids. 
jerry: that is so not true! 
rick: yeah it is jerry. the minute morty is old enough to realize monogamy is stupid, she ll divorce you faster than she realized having sex with you was the biggest mistake of her life. 
jerry: (nervous laughter) you have no idea what you re talking about. 
rick: the thing is burp i do, jerry. you re a pathetic man with a pathetic future. rick leaves. 
jerry: oh yeah?! well i had sex with your daughter! without a condom! twice!"morty's castle"3. 
rick  (o. s.) : and you should do it again if you want to stay married, pal. cut to 
[int. rick’s lab] 
there is a a book wide open on a bookstand on top of a super computer. inside the book where the pages would be are two monitors. there’s currently no text on the screen. morty and summer are trying to figure out what it is when rick enters. 
rick: she s somethin else, huh morty? 
morty: oh yeah! but what is it-er she? 
rick: she s the novel-t6. she scans text and converts it into a virtual world, morty. it ll make your books come to life. you get to live it, morty. live it. happy birthday. 
morty: thanks rick! but how do i live it? 
rick: easy, morty. this machine over here converts our minds and bodies into text and then uploads them into the virtual world. 
morty: that s so freakin sweet. what book should i get first? 
rick: (jokingly naive) oh, i don t know-how about a little story i found called morty potter! 
morty: you actually read my short story?! 
rick: yes, and i gotta say, it s a pretty cool burp universe you thought up there, morty."morty's castle"4. 
summer: this is stupid. why would i want to be in a children s story? first life lesson, morty, know your audience. 
rick: (sarcastic) oh excuse me, summer. i forgot your sophisticated reading resumé included the first 32 pages of infinite jest. how about instead of spending the day sending pictures of your tits to your class, you spend the day with morty? 
summer: i don t do that grandpa rick! i volunteer at the local shelter. 
rick: i m sure your college application really appreciates it. 
morty: is it like roy? 
rick: what s roy? (remembering) oh, yeah! that game at blips n chitz! no, it s not like that. i thought of this idea before i saw roy existed. they re similar, but different enough. now, step on the platform and put your helmets on. the three of them step onto the platform, put the helmets on, and sit down. rick grabs a video camera. 
morty: what s the camera for? 
rick: (laughing at his undeveloped joke) it s for-the-uh-the-uh- (can t find the punchline) ah, nevermind. it s to film your birthday, morty. don t you want to remember it? 
morty: yeah, thanks for lookin out, rick. the camera zooms in on rick as he explains his master plan."morty's castle"5. 
rick: (whispering to himself, but obviously loud enough for morty and summer to hear) he has no idea that i m really bringing this camera to document how humans would actually interact with morty s world. then i ll sell the book and movie rights and become rich. rick looks back and sees that morty and summer surprisingly heard none of what he said. (to morty) did you hear what i just said? no. none of it? mortyrick 
morty: (oblivious and excited) not a syllable, rick. 
rick: (confused) ok. well let s go. rick pulls a lever. visors lower from the helmets and a blue force field appears around them. the force field quickly scans them up and down a couple times. the scanner scrolls through words that then turn into numbers (like the matrix). the scanner stops and they are gone. cut to

beth: jerry slowly creeps up a little more. 
jerry: hi. so-uh-you know our kids?"morty's castle"6. 
beth: yes, i do know our kids. jerry creeps up even closer. 
jerry: you want another one? beth stops what she is doing an immediately focuses all of her attention on the conversation. 
beth: what are you saying? 
jerry: i want to have another kid. 
beth: no, jerry. it s out of the question. what if we got divorced? i would never want to put a kid through that. beth gets back to the dishes as jerry realizes what he has to do. cut to 
[int. train] 
rick, : looks train metal morty, and summer are sitting in a train car. summer bored and morty is enthralled by the experience. the car is lined with wood. the benches are red velvet with bars holding luggage overhead. 
summer: so what exactly is this place? 
morty: it s an academy for wizards. 
rick: that s right. you re a wizard, morty. morty looks out of the window. wizards are flying past the train without broomsticks. 
morty: where are their broom sticks? 
rick: broom sticks? see, that s one of the problems with your stories, morty. these wizards can kill people, control people s minds, and levitate objects. why not just make themselves fly? the broom stick was unneces- burp -sary and kinda gay. 
summer: how long are we going to be here? i don t want to miss my show. 
rick: (sarcastic) oh no! you re going to miss your show where one girl, tells-tells another girl to fuck off? you ll be too busy chatting up cute boys and playing water polo to notice. 
summer: there are going to be cute boys here?! 
rick: tons. the novel-t6 gives any character that s mentioned but doesn t have any real depth one of two character models that i designed. and when it comes to creating characters with no real depth, morty knows what he s doing. 
summer: wow, way to care about the little guys, morty. 
morty: (trying to convince) hey! i care. i just put more focus on more important characters. 
summer: so now they re not important? 
morty: that s not what i meant! 
summer: life lesson number two, morty. it s not the generals that fight wars, it s the soldiers. 
rick: enough! you guys are starting to make me regret having your mother. this is a stupid conversation, and summer that was a stupid example. soldiers are disposable, just like morty s attention to detail. the train s pa system beeps loudly as the train comes to a stop. 
train pa: now arrived at morty castle. 
rick: really thought outside the box for that one. 
morty: (jumping up and down) oh boy! 
rick: let s go ahead and stop at the gift shop on the way out to pick you up a wand. cut to 
[ext. wand hut] 
the wand hut looks like a “busy city” newspaper stand. surrounding the hut is an empty train station. a gruff man with a thick new york accent and a trucker hat sits behind the counter. his shirt says “i love ny”, but the heart is the silhouette of a women’s breasts. 
wand merchant: welcome to whatsittoyah s wands. 
morty: do you sell wands? 
wand merchant: whatsittoyah? 
morty: i d like a wand. 
wand merchant: go ahead, take one. 
morty: how much are they? 
wand merchant: how much what?"morty's castle"9. money. morty 
wand merchant: what s money? 
rick: i went ahead and ditched a currency system, morty. i may be an asshole burp , but i m not a freemium asshole. 
morty: i ll take this one! morty grabs a wand. 
wand merchant: (his eyes light up) oh! you ve chosen da most powaful wand we have. really?! morty 
wand merchant: i dunno, we re required to say dat afta every purchase. 
summer: i ll take this one! summer also grabs a wand. 
wand merchant: you have also chosen da most powerful wand we have. 
rick: alright, let s go. 
morty: aren t you going to get a wand? 
rick: i have one, morty. the most powerful wand there is. (he pulls out a wand. it is shaped like a penis) designed it myself. morty and summer take a second. look at each other and hesitate to comment."morty's castle" 
morty: why does it look like... that? like what? rick 
summer: you don t see it? see what? rick 
morty: nothing at all? 
rick: i see a wand. 
summer: a wand that looks like... 
rick: it could kind of look like a mosquito. a mosquito? summer 
rick: yeah, two big eyes, long, pointy nose. silence. fine. it s a dick. is that what you want me to say? jeez, you guys are immature. 
morty: what s so great about your wand? 
rick: i have the power to alter the text as the computer generates it, morty. here, watch. rick whispers into the balls of the wand and then shoots a white beam at the wand merchant. the wand merchant transforms into a toned, attractive man. summer is clearly attracted to him while morty is upset. 
morty: hey, why did you change him?! he didn t even have time to develop, rick!"morty's castle" 
summer: shuttup, morty! don t ruin this. (flirtatiously to wand 
merchant) : hey, giggle i m summer. the wand merchant goes to reply but as soon as he opens his mouth, golf balls start pouring out of it. he raises his hand from under the desk to reveal that his hand is a mini golf club. he starts putting them down the table as fast as the balls fall. summer freaks out and runs back to rick andmorty. 
rick: (laughing) see, morty?! now that s comedy! absurdity and burp misdirection! (serious) not some stereotypical character saying things you think are funny. rick starts to walk towards the school, rick and summer follow. (still talking to morty) challenge yourself. cut to

rick, morty, and summer walk through the woods and into an opening revealing the castle. it’s almost an exact replica of hogwarts castle from harry potter. there is an open yard with fresh cut grass and a fountain of morty with a wizard hat on. the yard is full of people, but they’re too far away to make them out. a pigeon with the head of a honey badger flies and perches on top of the school. 
morty: this is amazing, rick! 
summer: yeah, this is incredible. 
rick: (filming them) i know. now here, cheat out to camera. 
morty: i can t wait to meet new-they stop dead in their tracks. 
rick: what s wrong? the courtyard is full of students that look exactly like rick and morty except with poorly drawn faces in pencil[shown on last page of script]. rick, morty, and summer walk through the yard. a group of imitation ricks are seen wearing letterman jackets throwing a football. one imitation rick is seen glitching, stuck in a wall. 
morty: (jokingly) nice job, rick. really polished program you made here."morty's castle" 
rick: forgive me for having a inconsequential bugs in creates universes. what yesterday? jack off and blocks? couple a program that did you do play with a caterpillar inches out of a bush. an imitation morty launches out of the bush onto the caterpillar and shoves it into his mouth. uh-ew. summer 
rick: (directed to the real morty) yeah, morty, gross. a group of imitation mortys are seen casting spells at each other that make the recipient of the spell poop their pants. stop! 
morty: the imitation mortys stop for a second, then continue to play their game. why are they doing this, rick? i didn t write this! it s like your program made them, made me, like retarded or something. 
summer: hey! life lesson number three, don t be insensitive! that word is just as bad as the f word, morty. 
rick: that s burp retarded summer. i grew up on the word retarded. it s like the word jew . it s not offensive unless used offensively. and morty, that was burp pretty insensitive. 
morty: well, you know what, rick? it s pretty insensitive that you d make me mentally handicapped. 
rick: yeah, morty? maybe this will teach you to go that extra mile when writing characters. don t leave the readers to fill in the blanks. and they aren t mentally challenged, morty. pretty close to it though. why?! morty 
rick: i entered in the stats as i saw fit. 
morty: so you made my intelligence zero?! 
rick: relax, morty! your intelligence number ranges from one to five. 
summer: what s their intelligence? summer points to a group of imitation ricks cloning themselves. 
rick: (brag laughing) they re all flat hundos, baby! 
morty: this, this is low, rick. this is really insulting. 
rick: before you start bitching and moaning about numbers, know that you have a few maxed out stats yourself. like what? morty 
rick: for starters, your sex drive burp stat. how bout that, morty, huh? my man is desperate for a scoop of that poon puddin ! 
morty: you know what, rick?! i don t want to play! i quit. morty acts as if he is taking off a helmet."morty's castle" 
rick: no! stop! you can t take your helmet off until we get to a save point. if you take it off now, your data will be lost in here forever. 
morty: what?! christ, rick. i don t want to get stuck in here! not on my birthday! a bell tower chimes loudly. what s that? summer 
rick: class! come on, quick! we re almost late. summer looks directly at the camera and fixes her hair. 
summer: we were running late to class. i didn t know what to do! i was eager to- 
rick: what the hell are you doing? 
summer: isn t this, like, one of those- 
rick: no. we aren t doing that. summer, rick, and morty all run towards the entrance of the school along with everyone else. some imitation ricks start to fly from the courtyard through the windows while the imitation mortys burrow underground. as rick, morty, and summer run towards the double doors, one imitation morty stops burrowing and looks at summer. girl? 
imitation morty  1: an imitation morty next to him stops and also looks at

professor pringu: so nice of you all to join us. hurry and take a seat. don t make me ask again. 
morty: (to rick) is that professor pringu?! he looks just like i imagined! the three of them take the three empty desks in the back. 
professor pringu: excuse me. morty, was it? 
morty: yes, sir, or professor, teacher sir? 
professor pringu: yes, morty, please sit with the other mortys in the back of the class. but sir- 
morty: professor pringu uses his wand to magically bind morty and levitate him up and into the playpen. all the imitation mortys are staring at summer. 
professor pringu: can someone keep the mortys busy? an imitation rick tosses a nerd rope into the playpen. all the imitation mortys fumble over each other trying to grab the nerds rope."morty's castle" (monotone) perfect. as you all know, my wife left me last night. the entire room falls silent, aside from the mortys fighting over the nerds rope. (monotone) i got home from work yesterday and her things were gone. she left me for brian, a guy at her work. the class is still silent. (monotone) am i surprised? no. i knew something was up last month when she said she was taking extra shifts, but i saw no monetary increase in our paychecks. professor pringu grabs a piece of chalk and starts drawing a diagram on the chalkboard. 
rick: (to morty) congrats, morty. your best character is the wizard equivalent to randy quaid. 
professor pringu: (monotone) i didn t see any money coming in, rather, i was losing money. most likely due to their frequent trips to my grandparent s lake house. one day i noticed a pregnancy test in the trash can-rick is annoyed and getting anxious. he pulls out his wand and whispers into it. a school bell rings. (sighs) class dismissed. everyone enjoy the rest of the day and go home to your families. all the imitation ricks pack their things up as they get up and leave."morty's castle" 
summer: oh my god. class is over? that was fast. 
rick: yeah, summer. class tends to be fast when everyone knows everything. 
summer: what about the mortys? 
rick: you wanna burp teach a dog with no legs to play patty cake? a group of imitation ricks[strongly rick, studly rick, stunningly rick, squirts] wearing letterman jackets with their leader, brock, approach summer. 
brock: sup. i m brock. this is strongly rick, studly rick, stunningly rick, and squirts. me and the guys were wondering if you wanted to play water polo. 
summer: (blushing) yeah! that d be awesome.

brock: (delivering a sick burn) that shouldn t be a problem. brock and squirts high five with the tips of their wands. then brock high fives strongly rick with the tip of his wand while stunningly rick high fives studly rick, also with his wand. squirt high fives stunningly rick while studly rick high fives brock. it is a cycle of high fives with the tips of their wands with rick joining in. eventually, summer, brock, strongly rick, studly rick, stunningly rick, and squirts exit with rick following them with his camera.

rick: i ll film you later, morty. jeez, it s always the worst actors that want the most screen time. the door slams shut behind rick. the imitation mortys avert their attention towards the door and then at morty with a blank stare. 
morty: come on, let s get out of here. they continue to stare. morty climbs over the playpen and the imitation mortys gasp.

jerry clicks the tv remote. nothing happens. he clicks it again, still nothing. 
jerry: (slapping the remote) come on! what s wrong with this thing!? morty sits next to him and plays with his phone. 
morty: did you check the batteries? 
jerry: uh, de-doy! thanks, morty. 
morty: it was just a suggestion. jerry rapidly presses all the buttons. 
morty: i m gonna go see what rick s doing. 
jerry: great, i can t even have a day with my son. morty sighs. 
morty: why is this so important to you? we don t watch sports. 
jerry: but it s the big game! that s what fathers and sons do, they watch the big game. 
morty: do you even know what sport is played, in the big game? 
jerry: what does it matter, morty? spend some time with your father. fine. 
morty: morty sits with his arms crossed. 
jerry: now, to get this to work... hmm... maybe, the satellite dish is busted? 
morty: want me to ask rick? 
jerry: it s just a satellite dish. i can handle a broken satellite dish. 
morty: are you sure, dad? i mean-it s probably no problem for rick. 
jerry: so it s going to be a problem for me? you don t think i can fix it!? 
morty: what? i didn t say that. 
jerry: you inferred it. 
morty: you mean implied it? 
jerry: there you go again, belittling me. is that all you and rick do on your adventures, make fun of me!? 
morty: we don t even talk about you. 
jerry: oh! because i m worthless!? 
morty: why do you keep projecting your insecurities on me, dad? i-i-i don't even like sports! 
rick  (o. s.) : (from the kitchen) yo mortaay! 
morty: what s that rick, you need my help!? rick (o. s.) yeah-yeah, come quick. as morty rushes away, jerry turns around and points to him 
jerry: i m going to fix this satellite dish and we re going to watch sports damn it!

rick: u-u-useless as always, morty- (turning around) wait! what are you doing!?

[ext. roof - smith household - day] 
beth watches anxiously from below, as jerry finds his balance on the roof. 
jerry: (to beth) you know, you don t have to watch me. i m not going to fall. 
beth: i don t care if you fall, jerry. i m just making sure you don t destroy the house. 
jerry: beth, i know what i m doing. he picks up the power drill and examines it. hmmm... 
jerry: jerry uses the power drill to unscrews a couple screws from the base of the dish. 
jerry: so this screws and unscrews things! what do you know... (smiling at her) beth doesn t even blink, just stands with her arms crossed. 
jerry: i m kidding! he looks through the tool box and picks up an alien gadget. the gadget resembles a remote control with dials that has corresponding functions. he grips the first dial... 
jerry: intensity? full. jerry dials the intensity to the highest amount. radius? 
jerry6. : he looks at the size of the dish... 
jerry: definitely large. he dials it to large. 
jerry: what does this even do-just then a laser beam shoots out of it and hits the satellite dish which ricochets up towards the sky... 
beth: jerry... what did you just do? 
jerry: uhh, i know what i m doing. 
[int. living room - continuous] 
rick leads morty to the living room. 
morty: what are you doing with space drugs in the kitchen!? 
rick: what are you doing drinking out of random cups? have some forethought, morty. sit down. what? morty 
rick: d-d-did i stutter? sit down. morty sits down in the sofa chair.

rick: what are you writing a book? 
morty: i just-you know, w-w-want to know what to expect! 7. 
rick: it s going to be fine, you ll just lose complete control of your body. what!? morty 
rick: (grabbing morty) of this body, morty! you ll be free to move around in your other bodies. 
morty: other bodies? wh-w-what other bodies? 
rick: every other body you ve lived in, i-i-in your entire pathetic life! you re about to get unstuck in time, morty. enjoy it! tralfam acid isn t cheap. you drank, l-l-like twelve hundred flentils worth. do you know how many dollars twelve hundred flentils, converts to? 
morty: uhhhh, to twelve hundred? a beat. 
rick: what are you making a joke, morty? y-y-you a comedian all of a sudden? 
morty: no, i-i don t know. i thought it was a fair guess, i don t know. 
rick: five grand, morty. the answer was five grand. 
[ext. space] 
the laser beam exits earth and hits an orbiting satellite and bounces back towards earth... 
[ext. roof] 
jerry looks up and sees the laser beam head towards beth.8. 
jerry: beth! look out! jerry looses his footing and knocks over all the tools. as he falls, he grabs hold of the roof. he hangs. beth screams and jumps out of the way. the laser beam penetrates the ground and disappears into it. 
jerry: beth, are you okay!? 
beth: you almost killed me, jerry! rick and morty run out, followed by summer. 
rick: what s going on out here!? you okay, sweetie? 
beth: i m fine, now. 
jerry: (still hanging) i m fine too. rick looks to jerry. 
rick: shut up, jerry. 
beth: jerry, shot a laser into space and it hurled back and almost hit me! look! she directs his attention to the penetration spot. 
rick: a laser? what are you doing with a laser, jerry? 
jerry: it s your tools, rick! what are you doing with a laser? rick looks down to the tools all scattered about. he sees the gadget and picks it up. 
rick: was it this? 9. 
jerry: yeah, i was trying to fix the satellite dish to watch sports with my son. 
rick: jerry, you fucking idiot. what are you doing with my tools!? 
jerry: i told you, i was trying to fix- 
rick: do you know what this does!? do you know what you just did!? 
jerry: please. enlighten us. 
rick: always with the ill-timed sarcasm huh, jerry and you wonder why your marriage is goin to shit. hey! jerry 
rick: this is an extremely high-powered compactor, it can crush objects past the point of an atom! and you just used it on this planet! they feel a tremor. 
morty: w-w-what was that an earthquake? 
rick: a-a-actually morty, right now, b-because of your dumbass dad, the earth is getting squeeeezed down into infinity-you know, l-like a black hole, waaaay worse than seismic waves, b-b-but nice try though. everyone what!? 
rick: (looking at watch) calm down, not right away. we-we got like four hours before we get passed the point-of-no-return, at which point, well, th-th-there s no return. 
morty: what-what are we gonna do, rick!? 
rick: why don t we just sit back and watch the chaos unfold? (looking around) a-a-anyone? no! summer 
beth: no! 
jerry: rick, people are going to die if we don t do anything. 
rick: ohhhh, feelin a little guilty, are we? 
jerry: shut up, rick. i know you can stop it, so stop it. 
beth: you can stop the earth from turning into a black hole right, dad? 
rick: of course i can, sweetie. you know i just love showing jerry the business. another tremor hits and the loose satellite dish tips over and falls, passing over jerry and hits rick square in the head. he knocks out. dad! 
beth: rick! 
morty: morty shakes him. 
morty: rick, are you okay? 
summer: oh my god, is he dead? did dad just kill grandpa rick!? 
morty: i don t think so. it looks like he s just knocked out. jerry lets out a sigh of relief. 
jerry: oh thank god. now, i know this is probably a bad time to ask for help, but my arms are cramping up. they all glare at him. 
[int. living room - smith’s household - moments later] 
jerry and morty carry rick inside the house and lay him down on the couch. 
morty: wh-what are we going to do!? you heard rick, we ll be dead in four hours! what if he doesn t wake up in time? 
jerry: it s going to be fine, all we have to do is figure out a plan... that s what rick would ve done, right? 
beth: ugh, we re all going to die. 
jerry: hey! i started this, i can get us out of this! 
beth: yeah, keep telling yourself that. the house shakes again from another tremor. 
summer: should we still be inside the house, you know, if like the worlds ending? 
jerry: the worlds not going to end! besides, i think i have a plan. summer looks out the window. 
summer: our neighbors are all coming outside. should we tell them what s going on? 
jerry: i don t know... wouldn t it cause a panic? 
summer: they deserve to know the world s going to end, dad. 
jerry: stop saying the worlds going to end! it s not, i told you i have a plan. another tremor hits. 
beth: can we go outside, i don t feel safe in here? 
jerry: fine, but my plan needs a lot of help, so that s why i m choosing to go outside. they begin to walk outside... uh oh... 
morty: morty touches his head. 
summer: are you okay, morty? he takes a seat on the sofa chair. 
morty: i m-uh gonna stay here for-for a bit... i don t feel so.... the background blurs into....

morty: wha-what s happening? where am i? summer? 
summer: calm down. what s wrong with you, morty? 
morty: huh-i-i... he looks around the room. 
beth: are you okay, morty? 
morty: i-god, this feels so real! 
jerry: should we be worried about this? 
morty: where s rick? jerry looks to beth. 
jerry: uh, are you talking about grandpa rick? 
morty: where is he? beth starts to cry. 
beth: i don t know! 
summer: good going, morty. is this another one of your jokes? 
morty: what? no! i-i just want to talk to him. beth stands up. so do i!! 
beth: she runs out of the room. 
jerry: (sigh) morty, you ve done it again... 
summer: do you feel good about yourself? 
morty: it s okay, this-this is all in my mind. he looks up to a bewildered summer and jerry. 
morty: uh... right? 
[int. living room - smith’s household - present] 
summer waves her hand in front of morty, as he stares into nothingness... 
summer: should we do something about this? no answer. she looks up to see both jerry and beth already outside. 
[ext. smith household] 
summer walks out to see jerry waving down the small crowd across the street. excuse me. 
jerry: his neighbors don t acknowledge him. jerry stands on top of a parked car. 
jerry: excuse me!! they all look to jerry. 
neighbor  1: hey that s my car. 
summer: this is going to be such a train wreck. summer pulls out her cell phone and starts recording. 
jerry: there s no need to panic! ted, one of his neighbors chimes in. 
ted: no one s panicking, we re all staying calm. 
jerry: fred, is it? 
ted: no, it s ted, jerry. oh yeah, that s right, i remember your name. we ve only been neighbors for nearly a decade. 
jerry: well ted, and... uh, other neighbors. i know this is going to sound a bit nuty, but i know what s going on here, and i think we can stop it if your willing to help me out. ted s wife, elizabeth steps forward. 
elizabeth: you know what s causing the earthquakes? 
jerry: that s the nutty part, it s not earthquakes. the earth is squeezing in on itself! it s becoming a black hole! they all murmur in disbelief. 
jerry: i m serious! earth is getting smaller by the minute and in four hours we re all going to be dead, if you don t listen to me! i swear! 
ted: oh, jerry smith the scientist all of a sudden. another tremor hits, this time the land between jerry and the neighbors move drastically closer to each other. 
jerry: see! now you believe me!? we re all going to die if you don t help me! the crowd goes silent... elizabeth steps forward again. 
elizaebth: it s the apocalypse!!! the crowd screams and scatters. summer records it all. she flips the camera. 
summer: people of earth, you deserve to know the truth! she looks at her phone and uploads the video online. youtube page the view count on her video rapidly grows. 
facebook page: people share the video non-stop. 
news report: the video of jerry plays next to a news anchor. 
news anchor  1: we ve just been sent a video where a white male claims to know what s causing the world-wide earthquakes that have been going on sporadically for the past hour, saying that earth will become a black hole very soon. 
news anchor  2: a white male-black hole, now if that s not a sign for the apocalypse, then i don t know what is! pentagon

military personnel: general! you have to see this! he hands him a cell phone with the video of jerry. 
military personnel: everything he s saying about the earth, fits within the readings of our seismographs. it s the only thing that makes sense! the general watches the video for a second. 
ted: (from video) oh jerry smith the scientist all of a sudden?

rick: if you don t play along, you don t snap out of it. you can get stuck there for-for like years. so play along, okay? years? morty 
rick: yeah, it reeeally raises the-the stakes, huh? just sit still, so you can get the fuck out of here. a beat.

jerry: just let me have this. the entire room is filled with government officials, ethnic people on screens and the president of the united states. 
president: jerry smith? 
jerry: yeah? who s asking?... um. yeah, i m jerry. 
president: before you jerry, are world leaders from almost every major first-world christian country. and we all want to know, is it true what you said, that the world is growing smaller by the minute? 
jerry: yeah. it s actually going to be a black hole. 
president: how do you know this? 
summer: because it was his fault. 
president: and who are you? 
summer: summer, he s my dad. i see. president 
jerry: it s true, it s my fault. i started this, but i have a plan! if we all stick together, maybe we can stick-together, this planet. 
president: well, right now, you re our only hope. what do you got, jerry? jerry looks around the room. he spots a colonel eating a sandwich, sneakily. 
jerry: can i borrow that sandwich, sir? i ll give it back, don t worry. uh... colonel 
president: what are you doing eating a sandwich, right now? you know there s no eating in the diet room. 
colonel: i skipped breakfast, sir. 
president: give the man you re sandwich. the colonel hands jerry his sandwich. jerry holds it up. 
jerry: this sandwich is our planet. he shakes the sandwich, and the contents fall on the table. 
jerry: and just like our planet, it s falling apart. however-he pulls a toothpick out of his pocket. 
jerry: with this toothpick, the sandwich can stay together! he puts the toothpick through the sandwich. see. 
jerry: he shows everyone the sandwich, they all looks at him quietly. 
beth: that was your plan this whole time?

jerry: well, we obviously weren t going to use a toothpick. maybe a pole, like the south pole or something. what do you think i am, an idiot!? 
pilot: yes! i should kick your ass right now for wasting our time. 
jerry: shut up, you weren t even there. suddenly another tremor hits. this one is long. the pentagon begins to squeeze together... the pilot looses his balance and gets swept in between broken rubble. 
summer: no! our pilot!! what are we going to do!? the helicopter tilts sideways as the ground beneath it concaves in. the door swings open...

jerry: oh great! rick took the ship. see!? what did i tell you!? now we re screwed. just then a laser beam hurls towards jerry. 
summer: dad, look out! jerry jumps out of the way as the beam penetrates the earth like before. the earth stops shaking. rick comes back with his spaceship and lands in the garage. he steps out. 
rick: there, i-it s over. hope you re proud of yourself. you did some reeeal damage, jerry. earth is now mu-much smaller, which will drastically affect gravity, not to mention the-the electromagnetic waves. i bet a lot of people probably died too.

rick: no, you drug addict. plus you owe me five grand. jerry and beth are watching tv behind them. the big game is on. a presidential logo pops on screen with a loud beep. 
tv broadcaster  (v. o.) : we interrupt this broadcast of the interrupted big game to bring you to the white house. it cuts to the president making an address 
president: hello, my fellow americans. yesterday, will go down in history as the worst day not only for americans, but as a planet. we should be reminded, despite our political differences, or are cultural differences, that we are all human beings. those of us who survived this tragic day should feel privileged, honored, that you are able to live another day, eat another meal. you should be reminded that life, is something that shouldn t be wasted, but should be cherished. i wish i had an answer to why the events of yesterday happened, or why it stopped but know this... we will rebuild, we will survive and most importantly we will overcome! thank you. everyone looks to jerry. 
jerry: (annoyed) what? i said sorry.
